lated examples, as his admirers do, of a
feeling which, to be worth anything, ought to
constitute the tone of the entire correspond-
cnce? For instance, the editors are loud in
their praise of his affection for his brother and
his daughter, and of the sorrow he displays
at the death of an intimate companion. But
surely there is nothing specially characteristic
of Cicero in these feelings, which we may
fairly 'assume to have been not altogether un·
known to men like Catilina and Clodius.

On the other hand there are at least three
passages¹ in this book alone, in which such
a feeling is only conspicuous by its absence;
and, even when these have been explained
away, the whole tone of the letters is self-
ish still. Nine tenths of the book are occu·
pied with himself and his own concerns.
With the exception of Atticus, no one, save
the two or three persons to whom I have
already alluded‚ is mentioned with any de·
gree of interest, and in the management of
the one important concern with which he had
been entrusted by Atticus he is dilatory and
neglectful, and at last dismisses it from his
mind with an unsympathising comment ¹.
And as regards affection for his friend, l can
see little signs of it beyond the usual stereo-
typed commonplaces: and that Atticus felt
the omission is plain from the very remark·
able passage at the commencement of Ep.
xv11., which, so far from being an honest
exhibition of feeling, is no better than a vote
of confidence delivered at the pressing re·
quest of his friend. (Cf. §7 of the letter in
