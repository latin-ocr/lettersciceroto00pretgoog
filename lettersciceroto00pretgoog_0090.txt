NOTES 57

Caietam] The celebrated harbour (now Gaeta) in the
neighbourhood of which was Cicero's Fonnian villa In ΕΜ
he refers to the villa itseli under the name of Caieta For a
description of his numerous residences see Mr Forsyth’s
Cabiro, pp. 61-66.

Exposita] For the use of the word in the sense oi ‘ landed'
cf, Verg. Aen. x. 288, de bell. Gall. lv. 37.

ξ 3 Amico] L Lucceius. He was aman oi some literaryat·
tainments both as poet andhistorian (cf. Ep. oddiv. v. 12), and
was courted in consequence by Cicero who wished him to sing
his praises. ln the year 59 uc. he was an unsuccessful candi·
date for the consulship. To judge from Ep. 14, which was

written in the consulship oi Messala and Piso, the difference '

between himself and Atticus (ior the origin oi which ci 11.
1) must have lasted ior the space oi seven years. Ι

Quibus de suspicionibus] = propter quas suspiciones rather
than cuius ile suspicionibus.

Sallustium] not the historiari, cf. ad dio. xlv. ψ 11, od
Art. xi. 17. 1. ‘Sallust, though he was on the spot, 1 have
not been able to restore to his old place in his esteem I
mention this to you because he used to find fault with me
for neglecting your wishes. He has now found out by ex·
perience that our friend is not very amenable, and that I did
use my best efforts in your behali.'

Nec libi defuisse] 1 arn disinclined to alter the received
reading, which may be justified by the analogy of the follow·
ing passages, the latter of which is recognised by Madvig:
Pers. v. 172, and Cicpro Caso. >stimuum qui boc disputant,
si id domni, non recto aliquid stoluere eos qui comulontur,
nec boc debent dicere, etc. The alteration proposed by Schiitz
uec tibi mc sibi does not read pleasantly‚ and, had it formed
part oi the original text, would scarcely have been cor-
rupted. Noc meum studium tibi &fuisso appears to me
a more probable suggestion, as it reads well, and gives a
connection to the two sentences the want oi which is cer·
tainly felt iu the received reading. The objection which
Boot raises to the text on the ground that it makes do uisse
dependent on expertus estis surely hypercritical‚ ior the con·
struction may be easily explained as a ζεῦγμα.

Tulliolam] His daughter Tullia was at the time oi her
betrothal only nine, or at the most eleven, years old

C. Priona] His praises are sung by Cicero in the Brutus
(cap. Lxxvltt.) and elsewhere. At alater periodheabandoned
his quaestorship in Pontus and Bithynia that he might be
near at hand to protect his father-iulaw.
