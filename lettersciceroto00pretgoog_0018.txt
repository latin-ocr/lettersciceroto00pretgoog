ἱ Os actual immorality, nothing, in so far
as I know, can be proved against Cicem, a
fact whiclrI should be tempted to ascribe in

quite recently has held its ground, I can
only suggest the force of tradition, and the
sympathy which is so naturally excited in
his savour by the malice of his enemies and
his untimely death. ’
