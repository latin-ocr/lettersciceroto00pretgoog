any rate forcible enough as apert of Cicero's reply.

latter word could in any case be supplied, it would be next
to impossible to do so in the present instance where we have
another subject mentioned in such close proximity. We may
insertherefore that the allusion is to some spring or baths in the
neighbourhood of Arpinum: and the taunt may be simply
aimed at the devotion shewn by Clodius to the interests of
, Marius. But a sarcasm of this kind is not sorcible enough
to suit the occasion, and it is lar more robable that by the
word patronus some person is meant witli whom Clodius was
on the same terms as those which existed between the
younger Curio and Antonius (Phil. 11. 18). lt has been sug·
gested that the elder Curio may be the person in question,
but, although he had warmly supported the cause of Clodius,
his character and reputation render it most improbable that
he should have been made the subject of a taunt, the import
ol which can scarcely be mistaken. On the other hand, every·
thing points to the younger Curio as the (botranus os the text, ·
eg his wellknown character and the act that notably on
one occasion he acted as the champion os Clodius (duce
filiola Curiones, Ep. 14 5), while his father is known to have

urchased a house in the neighbourhood of Arpinum which

d originally been in the possession os Marius.
