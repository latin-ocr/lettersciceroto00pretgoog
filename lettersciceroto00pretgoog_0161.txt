Even so iar back as 1873 l had suggested in my notes:
(i) that sane facile must covttmence and not close a

. sentence,

(ii) that eum and not Thermum was required hythe
context, and

(iii) that a place must be found forfactum, the word
, regularly used in the election of a consul.

Is sorsacile eum (the real crux of the assage) we read Α
jactum eum, all the above mentioned di culties are then
and there surmounted, and the sentence eomes out thus:

quae tunc erit absoluta. Sane factum eum libenter cum
Caesare consulem niden'nn

Of course uiderim is very open to question. But, care·
lessly written (eg. reiderim), it approximates more closely
to aca'derim than any word l have seen suggested (eg.-
aceeperim, eto). Why factum should occur thus early in the

. sentence, is clear. It is the emphatic word. ‘The election
os Thermus is probable: if it is realised, l shall be content.’ ’

a closer rendering than ‘hke aman,’ though in sense perhaps

Ep. 111. ξ 1 auiam tuam] l cannot bring mysels to regard
this as other than a jest, especially as the phrase mortuam
esse occurs not unfrequently in the sense of ‘worn'ed to

follows (and Mr Strachan-Davidson, I think, offers the best
solution) ciuitates rather thanseriae must be understood with
Latinae. Such phrases as ‘in officio manere,' ‘hostias ad-
ducere' could only be used appropriately in reference to
persam or communities.
