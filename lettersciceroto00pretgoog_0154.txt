to it: all blame to me for not praising it in preference.
Though, look you, what l write is no mere panegyric, but
sober matter of fact. My brother Quintus is at pains to clear
himself by a letter, and assures me that he has never spoken
disparagingly of you to anyone. But we must sift the matter
when we meet with all possible pains and care: only do come
and see me at last. Our friend Cossinius who takes this letter

ἐ 9 De tuo auam negocio] The decree relative to Sicyon, ³
on the subject of which cf. Ep. 13.1 and the note on the
passage. The special object of the decree in question is
nowhere mentioned by Cicero. Ernesti considers that it was
simply a refusal on the part of the Senate to interfere between
an individual and the members of a free state-an explana·
tion which is certainly in accordance with the words which
follow: tu si tuis blandities tamen a Sicyoniis ramulorum
aliquid expresseris, velim me sareas certiorem. On the other
hand, Schi'rtz and Matthiae are of opinion that the object of
the decree was to exempt the Sicyonians, in part at any rate,
from the burden of taxation. A careful consideration of the
passages in which the subject is mentioned, more especially
of §4 of the ensuing letter, has induced me to accept the
latter as in all probability the correct view

Summa edam'orum voluntate] For summa Ernesti sug·
gests sola, eut his objections to the received reading are
scarcely satisfactory. ln the Journal of Philalagy (New .
Series, vol lv, no. 7, p. 113) will be found an admirable
article by Mr D. Β. Munro on the subject of the pedarii, in
which he conclusively refutes the theory that they could vote
but not speak in the assembly. The discessio (he says) was
uo equivalent to the modern division, but (as in Epss aa' Aa.
1. 20. 4) an incident in the middle of the (lebate, which was
no more a legal vote than the eries of ‘ Agreed' in the English

House of Commons‚ though the practical effect might be the ’

same in both cases. lt was in fact, or might be made, a
running division, spread over the whole debate, and sensitive

to every turn in the scale of opinion: adopted usually perhaps ,
by the pedara, ie. senators who were too far down in the lrst ·

to have an opportunity of speaking, but also bysenotors who
had already spokea Henotices that in Liv. xxxvn. 34 these
