payments‚ and notices the fact that the legal process avall-
able for the guarantor in case of loss was known as actio
deprensi (Gai. 111. 127). The word is only used once by
Cicero of a monetary payment, and the instance in question
supports the above view. Cf *ad div. 1. 9 9 nesi cum Marco

LETTER tx.

Epitome of Contents] §1 On the subject of tkez'r cor·
respondeum. ἓ 2 His eagerness sor flu promised statues,
mg requestfor infamatione respecting the Eleusinion mys·

§ 1 Devenire] The preposition as in devius, deverticulum,
&a denotes the uncertainty of- the destination. Cf. Brut.
xntl. consideranti, ad quos ista non translata sint, sed
neseio quo pacto devenerint.

§ 2 Signa Megarica] i. e. of Megarian marble of the class
known as κογχίτης λίθος from the quarries near Amphialus.
lt was pure white, easy to cut, and full of sea shells. Cf. the
following passage from Paus. 1. 44, μόνοις δὲ Ἑλλήνων Μεγα-
ρεῦσιν ὁ κογχίτης λίθος ἐστι, καὶ σφίσι καὶ ἰν τῇ πόλει πεποίηται
πολλὰ ἐξ αυτοῦ. ἔστι δὲ ἆγον λευκὸς· καὶ ἄλλον λίθου pollend-
repes, κόγχαι δὲ ul θαλάσσιαι διὰ παντὸς ἔνεισιν.

Arcae nostrae confidito] ‘Rely upon my solveney,’ ‘Trust
to the length of my purse! Cf. arcae nostrae fiducia (ad
Quint. fr. 11.12. ς), and Iuv. Sat. 111. 143 quantum quasque
sua numerum servat in arca, Tantum habet effidei. The
allusion is not necessarily to a payment in ready money,
as some editors would explain it on the analogy of the more
technical phrase er arca solvere.

Genus hoc est] ‘This is the line my fancy takes. That
kind of statuary which is most suitable for a training ground
is what Ι require. Lentulus offers me the use of his ships

= Pray attend carefully to my wishes in the matter. Chihus
sends you a request, and Ι second it, for any information you
can give us about the rites of the Eumolpidae'

Lentulus] Schiitz regards him as identical with the Len·
tulus mentioned in 1. 19. 2 on the ground that all the
other members of the family had held office and· were little
likely to be engaged in trade. But the latter assumption is
somewbat bold, while the contemptuous allusion in Ep. 19
suggests an enemy rather than a friend.

Chium] A poet, and in all probability the guest of Cicero
