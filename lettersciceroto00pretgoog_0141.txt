108 NOTES.

ing to a reed), 1 have paved away, and a safe one too 1 hope,
by which to retain my influence. 1 cannot tell you down·
right what it is in a letter: however l will throw you out a
gentle hint of my meaning. l am on the best possible terms
with Pompeius lknow what your comment will be. lwill
‘use cautiori where cantion is necessary, audon a future occa·
sion Ι will write to you at greater length about my pians for
the government of the State?

Ob iuda'candum] ie. in the Clodian trial. Boot raises an
objection to this construction, and pro ses to read ab rem
indurandam. But there is really no an ogy whatever between
the phrase ab debendum (for ab ius dicendum), which is
rightly quoted as faulty in Quint. inst. or. V. 10. 87, and the
one we areat present considering. The word aiedz'care is
complete in itself‚ while in the other phrase ius is manifestly
requlred to make the meaning intelligible. lt is true how·
ever that in reverting to the subject in a later letter (11. 1. 8)
Cicero uses the full phrase. ’

Pecuniam accepissent] The word pecuniam is not essen-
tial, and is omitted by Matthiae on the strength of a similar
passage in the ar. pra Cluent. 103.

In eausa naa verecunda} The gentlest of terms for a most
disgraceful transaction‚ an , as the Senate was in this case
on the side 'os justice, Cicero’s conduct is the more inexcus-

able. ln a subsequent letter (Ep. 11. 1. 8) he condemns it ·

himself in somewhat stronger terms: quid uan'us quam in
iudicium venire qui ab rem iudicandam pecuniam acceperit?
· censuit hoc Cata: adserunt senatus...quid im ualentius pub·
liranis renuntiantibus? We are glad to lin from the same
passage that Cicero failed to carry his point.

§9Asianz] Asiaepnblieam‘. Boot objects to the phrase
(which is however the regular one) on the ground that Asia·
nus can only mean a ‘native os Asia: Accordingly in Juv.
rat. vn. 13, he explains equites Anam· as servi exAsia arium
aa, qui manumissi ordini equestri adscripti sunt, and in the
present instancehas even admitted into his text Asiam qui
de censoribus conduxerunt.

Induceretur]=llvu ράφειν, to obliterate the writing by
drawing the thick enci of the stilus across the wax.

Adeo] i.e. ‘prince s nel potius secundus,' as Boot under· ¹
stands it, a sense of adea which, though rare, is not un-

exampled in Cicero. In a former edition l had suggested ,

the following rendering, as more in accordance with the usual
force of the word: ‘1 was their senior and junior counsel in
one, senior if you take into account the service l did them,

iunioris you regard the fact that 1 didn’t originate the plea’ ¹
