APPENDIX. 126c

What person, of any ordinary humanity, would announce

’ his father’s death in these terms: ‘My father died on such

ppSppffl a day. Ι think this is all the news 1 had to tell

ψ Ep. xr1.§1 Tebxpn1=Antoniun in which Mr Watson
agrees with me. ‘Antoniun beyond a doubt’ Dr Reid.

‘⁷ Cicero's object, as 1 understand it, was to veil the
identity os Antonius, and he finds a word ready to hand
which at once fulfils this purpose and satirises the effeminacy
oi Antonius. That he uses illa and not illo in the next para-
graph is, 1 venture to think, evidence in my favour. Had he
reverted to the masculine (as Proi. Tyrrell would have ex·
ppcteg) laeswotulcplpavziurpished a clue to the enigma and

erey eeae rsoyec.

Ep. xvi, ξ 13† contra legem Aeliam] In connexion with
this passage it is important to notice that magistratum
insimulatum lege Aeliu was suggested to me by the late
Pros. Munro with extreme reservation and a doubt whether
further examination would confirm the Latinity oi the phrase.
1 cannot myself find another example oi insimulare in this
connexion, and should be afraid, under the circumstances, to
accigtitsals Egigngligigymgriggested, the word cum in the
MSS represents coi (contra), the sentence will read thus:

,Lurco autem tribunus plebio est, qui, magistratum simul
(=simul cum) contra egem Aeliam iniit, solutus cst et
Aelia et Fufia, ie. ‘Elected in defiance os the Aelian law
and then formally released from the obligations of the
Aelian and the Fufian’ I may repeat, for the convenience
of readers, that the MSS give: magistratum imimul cum
lege Aelia im'it (orig. perhaps coit lege· Aelia). Δ

The'reading and explanation which 1 have suggested are,
oi course, mainly based on the words which follow: bono
ililllulluiln {liubilalltslthiclalllb
with the phygsical dyesonplity of Lurco as with the fact that he

“ ‘proposed his law about bribery at the time os the Comitia

ior¹ elections.' Both points, l think, should be ressed:
(i) that, being claudus, his election was irregu r, and
(ii) that his subsequent action was irregular also.

Ep. xvn. §912de ie. princeps uelpottlis secundus. For
instances of this usage Ι am indebted to Prof. Tyrrell’s

admirable commentary.
