68 N OTES.

agendumst, an almost hopeless confusion of tenses. On
the other hand, the ordinary reading quod intelligam is at
once the more usual formula, and interseres in no way with
the retention oi est, lor which the esset of some MSS is an
evident corruption.

In the earlier part ol the sentence the word troc refers
primarily to permzsr'sse, and is afterwards by a common con·
struction further explained in the sentence te non modo nora*
arcessi a me, sedprotibert

Offendor] Cf. ξ 3 oi the next letter: (res) quos tu incredi-
bile est, quam brevi tempora quanto deteriores effusurus sis,
quom reliquzstz'.

Diem dat] ‘Is lor taking the law on you,' vas in case the
debtor sailed to discharge the debt on the appointed day
legal proceedings followed as the necessary consequence.

S onsorem appellat] The editors are almost equally di·
vided7 on the question of retaining or omitting the negative
in the present passage. *l have decided to omit it with
Schiitz, Casaub„ Em. and others, on the ground that no
reason can be given lor Tullia's change of purpose if (as
we can hardly question) appellat is to be explained here in
the same way as in the parallel passage ol Ep. 8.

The reading spernerem me appellat, which finds favour
with Klotz and Boot, has little to recommend it. The pronoun
is certainly not required, and its introduction spoils the terse-
ness ol the sentence.

LETTER xl.

Epitome of Contents] §1 His negotzotz'om with Lucceius.
ἓἸ 2 His convoss for tlte praeornat. ἕ 3 T te decoration os
lois T asculan villo.

ξ 1] ‘I was already taking steps ol my own accord, 'ando
onreceipt of your two letters written persistently in the same
strain, have· been thoroughly roused to action. Add to which,
Sallust is always at my elbow pressing me to do my best in
the matter ol Lucceius!

Adsiduus] In its literal sense. Cf. Hor. Sat. t. 1. 82, and
the or. pro Coeo. xxn. where it is used of the labourers who
are regularly employed on a sarm: non si coactis hominibus
quam si voluntariis autetiam adsiduas ac domesticis.

Sallustius] See note on Ep. 3. 3.

⁸ Immototae voluntatis] ‘This change of feeling’ In Ter.
Andr. 1. 5. 7 we find the word as an adjective in the sense of

‘unchanged‚' while in the de Or. 11. 67 immutato oratzo is
used of allegory.
