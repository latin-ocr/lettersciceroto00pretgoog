46 NOTES.

⁸ praepropera] ‘Premature,' both in tim and place: the
comitia tribunicia, which was the first election in the year,
being the recognised time, and the Campus Martius the re·
· cognised place.

Ita...ut] ‘For they generally refuse him their votes on
the plea that they are bound to reserve them for me. So l
think it must further my interest as the news gains ground
that my friends are being found so numerous)

Cogitaramus] For the epistolary tense cf. Madv. 345.

Prcyiczrcz'] :profecturum esse, as in 11. 6. 2 quando repro·
ficisci utinc putes fac atteiam, and again in w. 16. 12. Boot.

Cincius] 1„ Cincius, ¹an agent of Atticus, to judge from
such passages as vn. 1,V111. 2, xv1. 17. -

ad. xvt] We may without hesitation reject the old read-

In illustration of the phrase ut frontem finias, cf. Dion.
Hal X. 9 wuiourtrrd μέτωπα, and Cic. Brut. LXXX. 278.

Mr Watson regards ingemuisse as a sign of grief ‘at the
impending defeat of a manos good character! But it seems
invidious to draw this distinction when the candidates men-

Moreover the words in lwc must surely referto the past
sentence as awhole. The improbability of Galba’s canvass
