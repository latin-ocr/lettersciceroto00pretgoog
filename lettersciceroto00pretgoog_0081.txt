jurist, and in the or. pro Flac. as praetor in Asia But the,
reading of the text is preferred by the best editors, and the
allusion is to L Afranius, a creature of Pompeius, who was
consul with Metellus nv. C. 694 ‘A nobody and the son
of a nobody’ is perhaps the idea

Palicanus] M. Lollius Palicanus, another candidate of
the same stamp, as we may gather from an incident which
is related of him in Val. Max. 111. 8. 3.

He had been a tribune of the people, and is referred to
again in connection with Afranius in 1. 18. 5, while in Brut.
Lxxu. he is described as contionibus turbulentis aptt'ssi·
mus.

§alie iis qui nuncpetunt] ‘Of those who are standing for
the present year Caesar is considered saie. The struggle is
thought to lie between Thermus and Silanus: who however
are so threadbare in friends and reputation that it seems
to me perfectly possible that Curius may be pitted against
them. But l am alone in this opinion. It suits my interest

refer both to the previous year.

Caesar] Lucius lulius Caesar, who was in fact returned
with Thermus. For his intervention after the murder of
Caegar see in particular Phil. V111. 1. 1, and again ΧΗ.
7.1 .

Thermus] Minucius Thermus, adopted into the patrician
gens Marcio, and mentioned in the Fasti as C. Marcius
figulus, He is supposed to be the Q. Minucius Thermus
to whom some of Cicero’s letters are addressed, a noted '
partisan of Pompeius in the civil war. Meriv.

Silano] Decius lulius Silanus, who was consul with
L Licinius Muraena A. υ. c. 691.

Ab amictb]=ex parte amicorum ‘in regard to friends!
The construction is apparently a favourite one with Cicero.
Cf. Ep. vm. 14 1 [ternpus] quod ntugt's debuerit mutum csse
a litteris: 111. 17.r [litteras] exploratura timore, and or.
