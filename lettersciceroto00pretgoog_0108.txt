NOTES. « 75

Cicero in ut scribis calls attention to the error, is e ually
impossible. But two other altematives are to be considered,
oi which the first and more probable is that ancoram sal-
vere is to be taken in the more poetica} sense of navem

¹ solvere, or funem praenitere, i.e., to cut the cable which

held them to their moorings. The other possible explana·
tion is to 'suppose that he had already been travelling by sea
and that he writes as soon as the ship had ancnored in port
This is perfectly tenable, as the place from which he writes
is not¹ stated, and may, for all we know have been one ο( his

auarum] ‘Masterpieces‚' ‘true works of art! I can see
no obJection to the phrase ‘worthy oi a rhetorician' lt is at
any rate better than the majority of the readings which are
proposed in its place ; e. g. quae fuemnt omnus. Raetorum
more loquuntur. Orelli’s emendation, quae fuerunt omnes,
ut rhetorum ἔπινέ loquuntur, κ.τ.λ., is admitted by Mr
Watson, and as certainly much to recommend it.

reading it through l'

Quod mini nan...cst] The word notum, or one equivalent
in meaning, is essential to the construction. Orelli proposes

a trustworthy man or the reverse Boot is scarcely to be
congratulated on his proposed emendation: quod minz· non

the commencement oi a campaign. ‘My (private opinion is
that you have by this time offered sacri ce at the shrine

Apud A malthaam] This may be either the nymph herself or
the villa in Epirus which she is sup osed to have underuber
care ; but caesas vicanis points to the former interpretation,
while the neuter Amaltheam is the more usual form in the
latter sense. The title denotes the abundant fertility of the
