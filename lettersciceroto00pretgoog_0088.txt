which induced Cicero to promise his services.

he actually defended him is still a matter of doubt. e
evidence, such as it is, is slightly in favour of Asconius who
decides the question in the negative. The fact that Cicero
abuses the court which acquitted him (or. ire tog. rauel) is
not decisive either way: witness his treatment of Fidicu-
lanius Falcula in the or. pro Caec. as compared with his
eulogies on the same individual at the Cluentian trial

Accusatores] Publius Clodius, who, for a consideration,
is said to have waived his right of challenging the judges.
(or. de liar. resp. cap. xic) lf so, the expression summa
accusatores voluntate is sufficiently explained. ln the ar.
in Pis. tc 23 a member of the same family (Sex. Clodius) is
charged with a similar offence

Sin aliter acerbaret] i.e. ‘if he declines to cooperate with
me,' and not in reference to his possible condemnation-for
in the latter case he would of course be unable to stand for
the consulship.

§2 T uos familiares] As for instance, Crassus and C.
Caesar, who were notoriously adverse to Cicero’s interests,
and perhaps also Phili pus, Hortensius and Lucullus, whom
he refers to again un er the name of ‘piscinarios nostros'
(Ep. 19. 6) as jealous of his influente in the state. The
cause of this feeling is illustrated by the following passage
from Sal. Cat. 23: Pleraque nobilitas invidia aestuabat et
{orcam pollui εὲἕέκΐίαίκηι cry‘d‘fffm si (ςένῖ ᾳτὲἰυηνιζῇ egregius

t especial interests of Pompeius.

Ianuario ineunte] We have in this another proof that the
consuls Caesar and Figulus were only elect at the present timet·
for, had they been actually in office, the January of 691 must
have been theone to which Cicero alludes, and by that time
the services of Atticus would have been useless. Besides we
ltnow from other sources that as a matter of fact he was in
Rome before the commencement of that year.
