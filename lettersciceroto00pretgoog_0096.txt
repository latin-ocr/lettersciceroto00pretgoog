NOTES. 63

Discessit] So Madv. for the more usual decessit, aud he
is followed by Boot and others who are unwilling to believe
that Cicero announces his father’s death in these brief and
Ἴ unfeeling words. They rely chiefly on the evidence os Asco-
nius, who in his preface to the or. iu toga candide mentions
as a fact that Cicero lost his father during the time of his
canvass for the consulship, i.e. four years after the date of
the present letter. In default of other direct evidence this
{philetihiiilieiffliffdilliieiiieiuiliitliisshssissfi
petually interchanged, if indeed the alteration is necessary,
as the verb decedere is used by Cicero in both senses. As
an instance of the special pleading in our author's behalf
against which l have protested in my preface let me quote
Billerbeck’s comment on the reading decessit: ‘The short·
ness of the notice shews how deeply Cicero felt his loss’

Quae leci siut] ‘Suited to the place you know so well?

xxcn] The same payment as that which is notified in

other authorities on the subject would in all cases represent

the number 400 by the characters cccc rather than by those
thch appear in the text =

kind from his agent, and can scarcely believe that the differ-

guarantee against further claims.' See note on 1. 4 1.
