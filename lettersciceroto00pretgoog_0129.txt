Bis Catilinam] Manutius has a long note in proof that
Catiline was acquitted in three prosecutions: (1) for the
seduction of Fabia, a vestal virgin, (2) for the murder of
Gratidianus, (3) for malversation in his province. For the
omission of the first in the present instance he accounts by
the fact that Fabia was the sister of Terentia, and that Cicero
had always maintained her innocence of the crime. lt would
be absurd therefore to refer to the prosecution as evidence of
Catilines guilt.

Immissum] immittere is the Greek ἐφίεναε, ‘to slip dogs
from a lensh.' Cf. Verg. Georg. 111. 351.

Exsilio pm'vare] Cf. fragm. or. in toga canti 1v. p 942

(Orell ed) ad alr uod severius iudicium ac ntaius supp z‘cr'um
, reservam, and alsoa remarkable chapter in the or. pro
Caecina, where it is again mentioned as the more lenient of
two alternatives (ον. pro Caec. xxxtv. too).

ξ 10 Pulchellus puer] ‘My pretty boy gets up and taunts
me with having been at Baiae. A lie, I answer, but what if
it were true? no worse than for you to say you had been
present at a mystery. ‘What’ he continued, ‘should a man
of Arpinum know of hot baths l' said 1, Tell that tale to your
protector, who had a strong fancy for the waters of Arpinum
(You know the stories afluat about the bathsofMarius) ‘How
long,' he asks, ‘shall we stand the airs of this great mani’
What! you to talk of agreat man, when your great man said
nothing about you! (for in his mind’s eye he had made short
work of the property of his brother-in·law Rex). ‘You have
bought,' he said, ‘a princely mansion) Yes: butnot the
judges. ‘Your evidence on oath,' said he, ‘received no credit)
Indeed it did, was my reply, at least, from five-and·twenty
of the judges: the remaining thirty one, seeing they were
paid in advance, would clearly give you none. By the shouts
which arose be was crushed, silenced and confounded’

Pulchellus puer] Cf. nd Art. 11. 1. 4 Fora repetition of
this sarcasm on his family name we may compare a frag·
ment of the speech against Clodius and Curio lv, ed. N obbe),
sed, credo, ntiquom speculum tibi adlatum est, longe te a
pulchris a esse sensisti.

Ad Baiassuisse] A sign of luxury and effeminacy, as it
implies the use of the hot bath. Cf. or. in Clod. et Cur. 1v.
