brother &cintus expected T erentia's heolin, ared conclusion.

ξ 1Fructu] ‘What enjoyment at home and abroad.' It is
better to take sorensis as referring to his public life in general
rather than to his legal duties in particular: although his
cousin must have been of great service to him in the latter, if
(as Asconius tells us) he travelled through Sicily with him to
aid him in collecting materials for the prosecution of Verres.

Lucii] The son of Lucius Tullius Cicero, the brother of
the orator's father. ln defin v, 1. 1 Cicero speaks of him as
fratrem, cognatione patruelem, amore germanum. He died
in the year 686, two years before the consulship of Cicero,
and this letter which announces the fact is consequently the

humanitateet moribus] Ahendiadys for humanis moritus,
‘ kindly ways.’

Meo sermone] ‘My account of you.'

nuptias sororis.

§ 2 De sorore tua] To judge from the very amusing ac·
count of their family relations which is given in Art. V. 1. 2
the fault must have been chiefly on her side, and we may
fairly hold Quintus excused.

Minorem] by about four years.

ξ 3 Delitterarum meinana] intermissione, MuretuS, which
however it is quite unnecessary to introduce into the text.
ln Demos. π ὸς Νικοστρ. 1251we have the precisely similar
expression ἐξ ἐμφανῶν καταπόσεως, ‘the non-production of
available'documents,’ and compare likewise τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους
ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑποψίαν, ‘the absence af all curiosity about our
neighbours' pursutts.' (Thuc. 11. 37.)

§ 4] ‘As regards your instructions about Aemilius, l
