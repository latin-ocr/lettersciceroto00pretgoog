have regarded it as such lt is no doubt apiece of pleasantry,
the object of which was twofold: (i) to hasten the return
of Atticus by shewing how much he was missed: (a) to deride
the easy going philosophy of his friend Saufeius. ‘Regret
for your absence has been the death of your grandmother,
combined with her fears that the Latin states would not be
true to their allegiance, and bring the usual victims to the
Alban mount. Saufeius, l imagine, will send you the corn-
fort you require on the occasion'

, Rei] With the Epicureans death was no evil, and it is in
reference to this view that Cicero uses the matter of fact word
rei in announcing to Atticus his imaginary loss. If we are to
regard the communication as a serious one this pleasantry is
most ill-timed: but against this view we have the fact that in
Ep. vlv. 6. 1, where he is alluding to au actual loss, Cicero
speaks in very different language of Saufeius and his school.

lower of the Epicurean school, of the tenets of which he was
an energetic exponent; cf. Ep. 11. 8. 1 quamquam licet me

passage is something to this effect: ‘Under the circum-
