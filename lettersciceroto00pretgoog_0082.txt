Curium] T urium, Boot, and with some probability, as
he is mentioned in the Brutus [cap. van] in the following
terms: L. Τ arius parvo ingenia, sed multa labam, quaqua ,
moda potarat, saepe dicebat. Itaque εί paucae centuriae aa'
consulatum defuerunt. But his obJ‘ection to the received
reading on the ground that Curius was a manos inlamous
character and had in consequence been removed from the
senatorial roll [Sall. bell. Cat. miris ol little weight, as it
is Cicero’s intention to disparage hermus and Silanus by
the suggestion ol some worthless competitor.

Obducem] ἀντιπαράγειν. This is, according to Boot, the
only passage in Cicero where the word is found in this
sense.

Caratar m'ar Flaminiae] Merivale quotes this passage
as an illustration ol the trifling circumstances which might
olten determine the choice ol a consul. The m'a Flaminia
led from the Porta F lumentana through Etruria to Arimi-
num, and was designed by the censor C. Flaminius n U. C.

Cum Caesareana] quae cum erit absoluta sane facila
eum libenter nunccetem' consuli mamam is the unintelligible
reading of the best MS, for which Schiitz proposes the follow-
ing : Quae tunc em't absoluta sanesacile. aa libens Thermum
Caesam'consulem accedere videram. The other emendations
which have been suggested are for the most part unsatisfac-
tory. Perhaps the only point which we can determine with
any degree ol certainty is that the words ‘quae tunc erit
absoluta' or their equivalent in meaning should form the end
of the past sentence rather than the commeneement of the .
new. But, with this exception, the reading adopted by
Schiitz appears to meto be open to objection on several
points: eg. the position of the words ‘sane facile’ at the
close ol a sentence: the introduction ol the proper name
Thermus alter so short an interval and when there has been
no change of subject: and lastly the unusual character of
the concluding phrase ‘Caesari consulem accedere viderim,'
an objection to which the emendation of Gronovius ‘Caesari
consulem addiderim' is likewise open.

On the strength of many similar passages we may fairly
l think regard the words ‘sane saeile’ as introductory to the
new sentence, while the substitution ol ‘eum' lor ‘Thermum'
is only a return to the reading ol the MS. Ol the word
‘factum’ Ι speak with less confidence. Itis however the
reczgnised phrase and, in addition to other passages, occurs
, in p.1(r13of the present book: ‘sed heus tu! 'videsne
