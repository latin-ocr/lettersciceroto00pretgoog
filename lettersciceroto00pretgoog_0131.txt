93 noras.

One other theory is worthy of notice if only from the fact
that it is countenanced by Schiitz, via that bypatronus the
sister of Clodius is meant, and that her discreditable par·
tiality for Cicero is the subject of the allusion, A rainatas aquas
comnena. Against this interpretation we rnust place the
unusual use of the word patrenus, the apparent want of force
in the addition of Marianas, and the general tone of the
fragmentary speech against Clodius and Curio.

Regem feremus] So again we have regnum Ciceronis in
the enpro Sall. vll. 21.

Rex] Q. Marcius Rex, the husband of Clodius' sister,
Terentia, who had died and left him nothing. For spe deva-
raverat cf. ar. pra dam. xx111. 60, and the following from
or. in Vere. 11. 1. 51 iste qni ram spe atque opinione prae-
dam illam manasset.

Domum] A ‘mansion’ which is the regular sense of the
word in Martial. lt would have been natural to refer this
to Cicero's house on the Palatina, noticed in Ep. 13. 6.
However, in the speech already quoted ,against Clodius and
Curio, Cicero implies that a house at Baiae is meant and
represents himself as commenting thus: arnae derit aedni-
care: nbi nihil liabeo, r‘be'suisse.

Potes, inquam, dicere, ‘indices emistii'] The reading of
Schiitz, with the exception that he omits the interrogative and
introduces the negative before potes. ‘Yest but can you say
1 bought the judges?’ Putes, inquam„dicere is the other
reading, which is understood by Boot in the sense of simile

.- est quasi de'cas above, and by the other editors as equivalent

to facile quispiam putet. But the taunt in either case
becomes less direct and loses in consequence much of its
force. Emissa for emisti suggests itself as a possible ernen-
dation. ‘YeS, and you can say you bought the judges!

ξ 11 Missus est sangnis] ‘l have been bled for unpopu·
larity without feeling the smart,’ or, in other words, ‘The fever
of jealousy under which l was labouring has been reduced
by bloodletting.' The same idea is found in the speech of
Appius (Lite. 111. 54) dandus invidiae estrangnis, in cic. ad
Ate. VI. 1. 2, and er. pro Sest. 38 sensit sunm saezgninem
quaeri ad restinguendam invidiam facinoris Clodiani.

ln passing we may call attention to the sels-complacency
with which Cicero dwells upon the increase of his own popu-
larity at the expense of a blow which he admits to have been
well-nigh ruinous to the best interests of the State.

Atque etiam hac magis] These words are generally un-
derstood as an amplification of n'ne delore: but it is, l think,
preferable to regard the passage missus est sangna's invidiae
