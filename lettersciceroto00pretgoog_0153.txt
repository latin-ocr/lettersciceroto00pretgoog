Asperum] ‘ln a word Ι have indulged in no severities,
but yet in no lax measures to curry favour. On the contrary,
my whole policy is so ordered that I shew myself firm in the
interests o the State, while in my private relations Ι arn corn·
pelled by the weakness of the good, the malice of the ill-
dis osed, and the hatred of the vicinus to use a certain car'e
anri, caution; and, while 1 form these new ties, 1 allow the
crafty Sicilian of yore to whisper in my ears ever his old
τεῐῐαιίε Be wary and mutmstful: the sineres of the soul

lta tomen] A condensed expression for atque, licet illa

Siculus] Epicharmus, though bornat Cos, passed the
greater portion of his life in Sicily. ln the T usc. desp. 1. 8. 15
he is spoken of as acutus nec insulsus-homo ut Siculus. ln

moredemonstrative members, though none of our party gave it
their sanction. When you complain that l witnessed the draft
of the bill, you might by referring to it have gathered that it
was a different matter that was then before the house, and
that the clause in question was an uncalled-for addition, for
which the younger Servilius is to blame, who voted last; but
no amendment can now be made. More by token the indig-
nation meetings, which at the outset were thronged, have for
along time been discontinued. lf, in spite of it, your bland-
ishrnents can succeed in squeezing anything out of the Sicy-
onians, l should like you to let me know. Ι send you an ac·
count of my consulship in Greek If you find anythin in it
which strikes oneof your natue andfamilyas wanting in reek
scholarship, l wont make the excuse which Lucullus made
to you, if l remember right, at Panhormus in the case of
his history—that he had introduced a few barbarisms and
solecisms at intervals to prove more conclusively that the
whole was the work of a Roman. Anything of the kind that
may appear in my treatise will be an unintentional slip. The
