OF CICERO. xiii

Cassius¹, is in part adopted by Mr Merivale in
the preface to his Life of Cicero, from which

I may be pardoned for quoting the following
passage: ‘It is humiliating to the pretensions

’ of human genius, but it not the less becomes
us to acknowledge it, that after all his efforts
to purge his mental vision of the films of
prejudice, Cicero was blind to the real fact,
that his devotion to the commonwealth was
grounded not so much upon his conviction of
its actual ments, as of its fitness for the dis·
play of his own abilities.’

Of the correctness of the above view the
following I think are proofs:

(i) His sels-congratulatcbn' at the increase ’ἥξω
of his own popularity from the failure of the fhuhsslf
Clodian prosecution, a miscarriage of justice
which in the next letter but one he recognises
as the death-blow of the commonwealth⁸.

' (ii) His conduct in exile, which is to me 3ζέῑῇ ⁰225
inexplicable except on the one supposition ‘”
that he had been throughout his life working
for himself and not for his country, and, as
in the days of his prosperity he had thought
and spoken of the republic only in reference
to himself and his consulship, so when his
reverses came upon him his concern for its
dissolution was swallowed up in a purely self·
ish sorrow for himself and his losses.

(iii) His sncndrlzc‘p with Pompeius, in con· ‘nggtlss
nection with which we shall do well to re· hu hhu-
member the following facts :—that it wasp‘m*

¹ Dio Cass. xxxvn 25, a passage of which Mr Merivale
gives the following translation: ‘[Cicero] was a mere time·
' server and passed now to one side now to the other in order to
curry favour alternately with each’ There isnothing more
extra-ordinary than the deliberate wayin which the verdict of
ιηξίἓὲἰὶζ tpulCic6ero'1s character has been habitually ignored.
