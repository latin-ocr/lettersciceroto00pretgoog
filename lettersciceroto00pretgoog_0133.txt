ooo NOTES.

by Pompeius is noticed in his life by Plutarch, ch. 443 and
again in Ep. ab Au. 11. 3. 1, et ,Epicratem suspicor, ut

Deterionis bistri'ams similis] al. deterioris. When all is
said, the allusion in these words is still only imperfectly
solved The reading detem’aris (which lt is attempted to ex-
lain by aa. 67. sqq. of the Prologue to the Amphitryon of
biamus) is now rejected by the best editors, who in the
word Doterio-a dispenset of bribes-see a parallel drawn
between the consul Piso (faeie magis uam facetiis ridi-
c'ulus) and the actors Aristodemus aab Neoptolemus, of
whom Philip made frequent use in administrating his affairs·

Apud magistratus] ‘The first that a commission of en·
qniry shall be held before the proper authorities: the other
'that any person at whose house bribery agents are enter·
tained shall be held guilty of a state offence ε’ the objectos
this double measure being the punishment of those who were

'ambifyu de iudiciis: nulla lex pe3r ta. 'There is scarcely a
doubt that this is the proper text aud interpretation of the
'stultit'‘tltttt'tbttlittttt tlltbttetb
usual phrase cuius domi. ln addition to this, the consul
had been active in procuring the acquittal of Clodius. Ut
apud magistratus inquiri liceret has been usually understood
as follows: ‘thatu't shall be allowable to search the houses
of magistrates :’ but the objection to this interpretation is
twosold, (i) that it makes the two clauses almost identical,
and (ii) that the measure in question is afterwards referred
to thus: ut de iis qui ab iudicandum pecuniam accepissent,
uaereretur (ad Att. 1. 17. 8). For adversus rempublicam
ferse or jacere), cf. ad Au. 11. 24 3 contra rempublicam esse ι
facturum. The other explanations are as follows:

(i) That cuius modi is to he taken as equivalent to puos-
cunque: ‘that, rf they harboured agents of whatever kind, rt
should be regarded as a State offense)

(ii) To leave out alterum, on the ground that what fol·
lows rs only a clause of the same decree: ‘that a commis-
sion should be held before the magistrates to determine what
sort of agents they held to be prejudicial to the State!

But in this case there is no regular sequence to unum,

while· the words iu consulempacta remain poi'ntless and un·
explained. Add to which ba erent adversus rempublicam rs,
to say the least, a most questionable phrase. ’
