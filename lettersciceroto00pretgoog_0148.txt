NOTES. 115

think, the alteration of edem into quidem is an easy and
effective correction.

Miles] The word is peculiarly suitable to Afranius, who,
as I have already noticed‚ had been one of the lieutenants
of Pompeius in Asia Itis strange that, not content with
miles, Muretus should have proposed so weak a word as
millies in its place. ¹ ’

Palicano] M. Lollius Palicanus (cf. 1. 1. 1), a tribune oi
the people, of such infamous character that, when he was
a candidate ior the consulship in a υ. e. 687, the consul
Piso declared that, in case ot his election, he should decline
to return him (Val. Marc 111. 8. 3).

Os...praebeat] Cf. Lis. tv. 3 5, praebere ad contumeliam os,
and Tac. test. 111. 3. 1, praeberi ora contumeliis.

§6 Agraria] This proposition, which had forits object

the partitron of lands among the soldiers of Pompeius, never
became law. Cs. Dio Cass. xxxvn. p. 52.

Plotia] The date and partidulars oi this measure are
rssplllrptprgn Like the present, it was clearly a tribunician

Togatam illam pictam] Notice the disparaging diminu-
tive. The full details of his triumphal entry are given in
Vell. Pat. 11. 403 and Dio Cass. xxxvn. 21.

Caeteros] In particular Lucullus, Q. Hortensius and 1.
Philippus. Cf. Itos piscinarios, Ep. 19. 6, and 11. 1. 7, nostri
autem principes digito se caelum putant attingere, si mulli
barbati in piscinis se'nt qui ad manum accedant. ·

§ 7 Legationes] See the note on Ep. 14 ς, and ci Ep.
ad dio. 1.41. The tactics of Cato on this occasion are
alluded to as follows in the or. ro Plane. xiv. 34, quum
senatus impediretur quominus, isquoa' hostibus semper erat
tributum, responsum equitibus Romam‘s redderetur.

§8 Quae scnpsimus (tanta)] It is of course impossible
that the word tanto can retain its present position, although
Boot justifies it asan attraction : while Matthiae now rejects
asan interpolation the arenthesis tanta es perspicacitate,
which appears in most oi) the editions. ln place of tanta he
proposes cuncta: but the omission of the former word is
really all that is required, which may possibly have crept
into its present lace from the juxtaposition in some MS of
the word tanti wbich occurs below.

Ne absens remeare] We find from Gellius that, in a .
speech delivered by P. Scipio Africanus during his censor·
