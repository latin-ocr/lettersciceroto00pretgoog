106 NOTES.

ξς] ‘One part of your letter was quite uncalled¹ for,
wherern you detail the opportunrtres of advancement either
at home or abroad, which you have allowed to escape you
both on other occasions and during the time of my consul·
shlp. For Ι know full well the nobleness and greatness of
our disposition, nor, to the best of my belief, has there ever

n a discrepancy between us excepting as regards the
choice of a profession, when a feeling of ambition led me to
hururzttlmmlh w attraherentur}
More ‘by token 1n that true gibry, whrch rs the ¹reward of
iura usandum hirneawerna
included, while m affectionate devotion to my interests, next
tIo the affection of my brother and my family, the first place
grve oyou.

Aliis temporibus} This and similar allusions make it evi·
dent that, in spite o the words mllem ut ires in the former
letter, it was ln obedience to the wishes of Cicero, expressed
or unexpressed, that Atticus had declined the post.

Voluntatem institutae vitae] ἡ τοῦ βίον προαίρεσις.

Quum...discessz] ‘second only to.' Cf. Ep. ad div. 1.
9. 18, and again vl. 12. 2 Caesaris familiares...quum ab illo
discesserintmelrabent proximum. ,

Primus nli defero] sub. partes.

§6 Sermom's communicatio] ‘'Thar interchange of thought
which used to be so pleasant between you and me.’

§7] The passage which follows destroys all the value of
the foregoing as a natural expression of feeling: shewing as
it does that it uras merely an official statement necessitated
by the request of Atticus, who wished that his motives, so
scantily acknowledged by Cicero, should no longer be mis-
construed by the world at large. This much at all events is
plain from the context, and it does not reflect much credit
on Cicero, that he was anxious to have Atticus near at hand
in the troubles which he saw were approaching, and had
accordingly discountenanced his visit to Asia, leaving Atticus·
the while to bear the brunt of Quintus' displeasure and the
charge of inconsisteucy with the Roman public.

Verecunda] ‘Has been repeatedly presented by a natural
bashfulness on both sides)

Incommoditate] ‘And in all the discomfort which has been
caused you by the estrangement and irritation of his feelings
there is yet this one advantage, that myself and your other
friends have at last received evidence in your own hand·
