NOTES. 69

Illud tuum arbitm‘um] ‘That decision of yours in his
case,' a more natural expression, as it appears to me, than
illud suum arbitrium, which Klotz and Boot have admitted
into their text, and which could only mean ‘the arbitration
which is for ever on his lips!

Nostra adlegatio] ‘Diplomacy of mine! The difference
between legare and adlegare is scarcely so definite as Boot
and others have imagined, who would restrict the former
word to affairs of state,›the latter to those of individuals: a
distinction which is not universally observed, as we may
gather from the use of the word in Plin. Pau. 70 leue senatui
adlegandum putaui. More probably the primary idea con„
tained in adlegatio is that of secret and even underhaud
dealing (cf. Ter. Α mir. V. 3. 28 ue credas a me adlegatum,
ie subornatum), a suppositionwhich accounts for the or·
dinary use of the word in connection with the private affairs
ol individuals, and also serves to explain its meaning in
the passage quoted above from the Panegyricus.

Tanti putares] ‘If only you think it worth the trouble!
1 have followed the punctuation of Boot, which, from the
position of the word id and the rhythm of the sentence,
seems to me far preferable to that which is adopted by
Klotz and the other editors: si made tanti putaris id, quod,

{laterbe aude'es et si humanitati tuae coenitare uoles, certe
u es.

In nostra potestate fore] Cf. §a of the last letter.

Idem] ‘1 nowen tiu other haud seem to distrust my
powers' For this use of idem cf. amongst many other pas·
sages de nat. Deae. 1. 43 [Epicurus] quum optimam et
,t'ffmstantissimm naturam Dei dieat esse, negat idem esse iu

engratiam.

obfirmatior] ² More persistent in this fit of spleen‘

In utro culpa erit] ‘Shall still annoy the one who is to
blame) Great exception has naturally been taken to this
careless and selfish decision on the part of Cicero. To those
whose business it is to explain away the force of all such
passages the following suggestion will probably recommend
rtself: sempsit liae, opinor, Cicero ut Epicureum Attici tor·
parem excitaret. Niml in tritus est epismlir unde collegas
falso queri Lucceium: suut autem multa quae agnatum
priesectam esseut A ttico grauem iniuriam. Oliv.

§ 2 Α rbitrari] The omission of the subject te is worth
of notice, more especially as C. T. Zumpt (Verr. v. rogi
quotes this as an instance in which arbitrari is used by
Cicero as a passive. lt may however have been due to the
fact that he rs quoting frorn a letter ol Atticus. We havea
