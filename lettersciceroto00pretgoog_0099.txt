at the present time. He is mentioned on two other occa· 3
sions in the letters to Atticus, viu in Ep. 12. 2, and again in 1

Ep. 16. 15, from the latter of which it may be inserted that he
glalglpizone time engaged on a poem in praise of Cicero’s con·

Εὐμολπιδῶν πάτρια] Gronovius would take Εὐμολπιδῶν in

a general sense as equivalent to Ἀθηναίων, but the allusion t

is in all probability to a proposed poem on the Eleusinian
rites, ior which Chilius wants a groundwork of facts. An
account of the external ceremonial is no doubt all that he
requires: for Atticus would probably know as little as hirn-

seli of the more secret mysteries which it was death to reveal. ·

ξ 1 Ceramico] There were two places oi this name at
Athens, one outside the city, the other within the walls.
The allusion in the present case is to the tormer and more
famous oi the two, which Thucydides in the funeral oration
calls ‘the fairest suburb of the city! It is probable that this
villa of Atticus is the one alluded to in the Leges (1. 13).

used in the same way, and very rarely temen, of which how-

senting the attributes ot the two divinities combined in one
person. As an illustretion of the latter class we have the
celebrated description of Vertumnus in Propertius [V. 2].
