54 noras.

Eius] So Klotz and Boot ior ἡλίου, which is retained by
Nobbe, though entirely unintelligible. Schiitz would read

illius, but in the similar passage of Ep. 4 3 eius is the
word used, and as an emendation it is perhaps scarcely more

violent

Gymnasium] i.e. a school for study and recreation, which
he had designed in his Tusculan villa on the model of the
old gardens of the Academe. The villa itself had once been
in the possession of Sulla and was situated about twelve

miles from Rome.

LETTER 11.

Epitome of Contents] §n Tlre birth of ason. His in-
tention of defhnzhizg Catiline. §a A request that Atticus
will come to Rome with all possible speed.

§1 C. Marcio Figulo] The Thermus mentioned in Ι. 1. 2.
The date os this letter is remarkable as referring in all pro-
bability to the day when the new consuls were elected, not
to that on which they came into office.

That the consules desi nati were often mentioned simply
as consules is clear from ξύ. ad. Art. vn. 8, Phil. XIV. 3. 8 : but
in this instance Cicero had probably a special reason for
departing from the usual formula, as he may have wished
to notiiy with precision the day on which his son was born.
The above explanation, which is countenanced by Schlitz,
is likewise supported by the contents of the letter, so'r
Catiline was put ou his defence in the consulship os Cotta and
Torquatus, when Caesar and Figulus were the 'consuls elect
for the ensuing year. The alternative involves the assumption
that Catiline was twice tried for different offences.

Filiolo] Marcus. Mr Watson has collected the details of
his life, which, though eventful in itself, left little mark on the
history of his times.

Catilinam] ‘I am preparing to defend my rival Catiline.
We have the very judges we wanted, and the prosecutor is quite
content. If acquitted‚ 1 trust he will work more heartily with
me in the matter of my canvass. If otherwisc‚l shall bear it
like a man? The whole oi this incident-whether as regards
his readiness to undertake the desence os aman whose guilt (he
admits) was as patent as the noonday sun, or the suggestion
of underhand play in the reiectio iudicum, or the motive

which influenced his conduct on the occasion—is in the ⁷

highest degree discreditable to Cicero. Catiline was favoured
in his canvass by Crassus and Caesar, and it was the iear
of their influence and the desire sor some compromise
