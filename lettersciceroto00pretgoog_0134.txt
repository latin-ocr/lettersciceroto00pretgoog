from a class of 'the same name who were legally authorised
to distribute certain funds among the tribeS, and to whom
reference is made in· Ep. 18. 4 tribulis enim tuus est, et

of this kind were occasionally supplied by the State itself is
clear from the phrase contionalis hirudo aerarii in ἓ 11.

ξ 13 Contra legem Aeliam] An emendation which I have
ventured to introduce into the text on my own authority, as
the Medicean MS, on which we are mainly dependent for the
text of the letters, is a comparatively late one, in which the
contraction of contra into contr. or coil might not unreason·
ably be expected to occur. Qui mgistratum omui cum
lege Aelia iniit is the usual reading, which has been rejected
as hopeless by Ernesti, Schiitz and Matthiae, all of whom
omit the words cum lege Aelia from their text. Nor is it
difficult to see that the fault, whatever it is, lies with the
words simul cum, which, as they at present stand, are Latin*
for nothing—certainly not for solva lege Aelio (Gronov.), or
for irz'bunotum inivit servatis auspiciis ex legeAelia (Manut.)‚
while their juxtaposition with the ablative lege is against our
separating them thus: qui, omui cum iniit magistratum lege
¹Aeli'o, solutus esi Aelio et Fufia. Moreover it is scarcely
possible that Lurco can bave been elected to office otherwise
than by a direct breach of the Aelian law, if we compare the
sarcasm ‘bono auspicio claudus’ with the first clause of the
law in question, ut auspicato omnio fierent io comitiis. As
the next step, we may fairly assume that such a breach of the
law would be alluded to by Cicero in a passage like the pre·
sent, and l have therefore little hesitation in obtaining this
'sense by the slight alterationes cum into coti (contra). By
removing the word cum, the difficulty of separating simul
from the ablatives which follow is removed with it, while a
most forcible rendering is secured for the passage5‘Elected
in defiance of the law and then formally released from its ob·
- ligations.' In respect to the relative qui, we may either omit
itas an interpolation consequent on the corruption of the rest
of the sentence, or, if it is to be retained, supply the verberi,
which I have introduced in brackets. ln either case, simul
will be equivalent to simul cum, a poetic usage which is not
uncommon in Cicero.
