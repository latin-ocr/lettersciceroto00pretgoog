122 NOTES.

two ways of giving a silent vote are mentioned as alternatives ι
aut uerbo assentire autpedibus iu sententiam irc.

Nostrum] i. e. senators who had held curule magistracies.
These were ranked in the following order: cementi, comu-
lures‚ praetorii, aedilicii, tribunicii, quaesterit, aiter which
came those who had held no magistracy. The princeps
senatus was as a rule the eldest person who had eld the

censorship.

Auctoritate] ln the same way praescriptio, auctoritates
praescriptae are the signatures by which the leading senators
attested the draught oi a decree Ci. ad diu. vm. 8. 5. The
phrase esse adscribendum appears again in Ep. ad dtu.
ΧΗ. 29. 2 coruulibus illt‘s uunquamsuit adscribendum.

P. Servilio filio] who on this and similar occasions sol·
lowed the lead of Cato. cf. 11. 1. 10 quod Simonii te laedunt,
Catoni ct eius aemulatori attribuis Servilio. The word filius
is added to distinguish him irom his father Ρ. Servilius
IsauricuS, who was still living.

Conventus] These were not necessarily confined to sena·
tots, as Schiitz and Matthiae have imagined, but were
irregular meetings held bynhe interested parties outside the
walls oi the Senam-house.

ξ 10 Homini Altt'co] Cl'· ιίιτιιιοίπιρα (Ep 13 5) and puto
Zrfflpirffiip dilecturi, Ιιιιὶα autem Graeco Graecum inui-

De suis historin] On the subject oi the Marsian cam·-
paign (Plut. Luc. cap. ι.) The word veihona is equivalent to
iiiiiii’siiosssiiissieaits⁰0i¹¹h⁶iiilid¹³le⁰t nanneni„

. τίς πατέρ’ αἰνήσει 3] The proverb is given infull by Plutarch
in his Life us Arnim, ch. X ris πατίρ αἰνήσει ei μὴ κακοδαί-
μονες olol3 and he appends the following comment: τοὺς ἀφ’
αὑτῶν ου’δινὸς ἀξίους, ὄντας, ὑποδυομένους δὲ προγόνων τινῶν
ἇρεταῖς καὶ πλεονάζοντας ἐν τοῖς ἐκείνων ίπαίνοις ὑπὸ τῆς
παροιμίας ἐπιστομίζεσθαι There is some difficulty, however, in
determining its application in the present instance. lt may
mean: ‘ ll praise oi near relations is to be discouraged, much
more by consequence the praise oi self'—an explanation
which suits the context well, and for which we have a near
equivalent in English. Ernesti, on the other hand, would
explain it thus: ‘To praise your past life is, by comparison,
to disparage your present’

ξ 11 Cossinius] Lucius Cossinius (Ep. ao 6, 11.1. 1). H
is mentionedagain in Ep. addin. xm. ²3· r. ·
