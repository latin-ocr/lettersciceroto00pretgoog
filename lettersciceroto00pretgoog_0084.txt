campaign, and prove formidable antagonists. Casaubon
would appear to have understood the words in a slightly
different sense, to judge from the following note: quasi dt'cat,
inulti nobiles qui absunt.

Cura ut praestes] i. esec ut milri caveas ab r‘stis Pompeii
asseclis, ne eos competitores habeam, Schiitz. But ‘take care
to secure me the votes of his retinue' is certainly the more
natural interpretation of the words, and more in accordance
with the ordinary usage of praestare.

Illam manum] i. e. the influential voters who had accom-
panied Pompeius on his Mithridatia campaign. The phrase
praestare illam manum may refer to their votes or else to
their indirect influence. It is not necessary to confine it to
the latter, as from the sentence which follows it seems clear
that some of them, if not Pompeius himself, would be able
to attend in person at the election. The explanation sug·
gested by Boot is scarcely satisfactory : otest tumen quoque
iudicari opera et auxilium Pompeii. uc ratione emptores
Graeci utuntur voc. χείρ.

§3 Pervelim] ‘But there is a matter, by the way, for which

of the proceedings. Caecilius has requested me to appear
against Satrius!

FratreRMr Watson notices that in this case, supposing
fratre to ave its usual meaning, one of the two brothers
must have changed his name by adoption, or else they must
have been brothers on the mother’s side.

Dolo mala] The adjective has been referred by some to
mancipio, but, besides being the recognised formula in use
on such occasions (cf. de off. 111. 14, 60), the rhythm of the
sentence would alone be enough to shew that the words ‘dolo
malo' cannot possibly be se arated In the resent instance
the fraud consisted in the ‘ egal transfer o property which

Lucullus] Lucius Licinius Lucullus is probably meant,
the friend of Caecilius as we are told by Nepos in his life of
