xii ΟΝ THE CHARACTER

Neither can it be said that he was averse
to bribes, when offered in the shape of 0ffice¹‚
for of money and houses he had enough and
to spare. His shortcomings on this head
have, Ι know, been excused on the ground of
precedent and the usage of the times: another
plea with which I have but little sympathy,
for the times were not so destitute of good
examples as it is the fashion to suppose:
while, if he is to justify the praise of his ad·

ultimate aim and object for which he was
content to sacrifice honour and seh-respect?
His immediate object in dropping the Clodian
‚prosecution was unquestionably and by his
own admission' to prevent at any eost the
disunion of the optimates and the collapse of
the existing govemment. We have therefore

sidered it the best field for the display of his
powers, and (ii) because he wanted time to
sorecast the future and to shape his own
conduct accordingly. This view of his cha·
