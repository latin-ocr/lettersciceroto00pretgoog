xiv ΟΝ ΤΗΕ CHARACTER

closely preceded hythe bitterest enmity to·
wards him: that it had its origin in a period ,
when even the least practised eye must have
seen that no one man could any longer save
the republic, and that Cicero acknowledges

the fact in the very letters in which he con·
gratulates himself on having secured Pompeius
as his patron: that he was clearly heartbroken
,. at the downfall of this friend¹‚ yet was at the
same time able to use the most temperate
language over the ruin of the commonwealth'‚
nay evento congratulata himself that the
claims of Pompeius with posterity would no
longer outweigh his own'. In a word, Ι cannot
believe that he was induced to court Pompeius
in preference to Caesar, or Cato, or Clodius,
by any motive· except sels-interest and a mis-
taken idea that he was the man of the future,
for he knew his character‘ and his aims⁶,
while of faith in his political professions‚ under
cover of which the alliance between them was
formed, Cicero by his own admission had
little or none. Even Abeken admits that the
conduct of Pompeius ‘ought to have opened
the eyes of every unprejudiced person,’ while,
as regards his own motives, Cicero is suffi-
ciently explicit in the following passages:
‘sed tamen, quoniam ista sunt infirma, munitur
quaedam nobis ad retinendas opes nostras tuta,
at spero, vta, quam tibi litteris satis explicare
noa passum· sagnzficatiane parva ostendam ta-
men. utar Pompeia familiarissime (1.17.10),
and again: patavi milti maiores quasdam opes
