84 NOTES.

' Perstrictus esset] ‘Wounded,’ ‘roughly handled' For
this use of perstringere cf. Brut. xcw. comuldtus meur primo
illum leviter perstrinxerat. The word litterae includes his
writings of whatever kind, eg. the speech ior the Manilian
’ law (ch. 11), and that for Sestius (ch 31)—passages which
teem with the praises of Pompeius as the conqueror of

ξραὲῐαωε, when the insurrection had been virtually suppressed
y rassus

, §4 Crasso adz'unrit] ‘That day has made me the close
ally oi Crassus) This compliment on the part of Crassus
was well timed, perhaps intentionally so, as by it he dis-
armed the animosity oi Cicero till his designs in reference
to the trial had been accomplished ’

Aperte tecte] The juxtaposition oi these two words has
occasioned considerable difficulty, but there is really little
doubt that they are to be separated in translation, and were
only‘brought together to heighten the contrast between them,
i. e. quod ille milri tecte dederat, aperte accepi. Two other
‘ {distrahitis{trittallttttktktnth
as an oxymoron: ‘with artful candour.'

Ego eutem ipse] ‘For myself, great Heavenl how I did
flare up for the benefit ot my new pupil, Pompeius. li
ever periods, or turns, or syllogisms, or flourishes came at my
call, they certainly did so then. ln short I brought the
house down. For this was my theme: the dignity of our
order, and its harmony with the knights, the unity oi Italy,
the dying embers of the conspiracy, the cheapness of pro·
visions, the 'prevailing peace. You know by experience what
my thunders are on topics like these: so lond were they on
this occasion that Ι may be brief, ior l think they must have »
reached you even across the water)

n ε’νεπερπερευσάμην] ‘HowI did shew offi'adrruk λεγόμενον in '
classical writings, although it occurs in Epictetus andin the
Ep. ad Corinth. 1. xiii. 4 ἡ ἀγάπη οὐ περπερεύεται. Καπεπείρεται
is the gloss of Hesychius, and the word πέρπερος is described
as equivalent to ἀλαζών.

ἐνθυμήματα] Rhetort'cal syllogtsms: while κατασκευαί ac·
cording to Gronovius and Schiitz are figurae elocutionis.
Ernesti on the other hand regards the word as equivalent to

- confirmationes, constructive as opposed to destructive argu-

ments (deuexerat). Mr Watson still edits καρποί in place of
καμπαί, but the latter has been received as a certain emende-
tion by Schiitz, Matth and others.

Intermortms] The emendation of Ernesti. which is εον,
