§⁶ 1 ePompeiano] The neighbourhood of Pompeii was rich
in villas. Thus, in addition to the one owned by Cicero,
mention is made in the letters of one which had belonged to
Marius (od div. V11.*3)‚ and another in the occupation of
Pansa (aderet. V.3. 1). · ⁴

· Indicium] Cf. Ep. 17. ς mini enim perspecto est in·
genuitas et magnitudo animi tui.

A nobes atque nostris] Schutz is inclined to regard the
words nobis atque as an rnterpolatiom on the ground that in Δ
no other passage does Cicero impute blame to himself for the
disagreement which had arisen between his brother and

nihilominus, qni regionibns exclusi intro praesidia atque
intra ormo olieno venissent.

Nilu'l amplum, nibil excelsum] This criticism of Pom·
ius is almost identical with that contained in an earlier
. ζητῶ. 13. 4).

’ Ao tranquillitatem meorum temp] ‘To ensure my peace
of life’ That this was in reolity his chief motive for forming
the alliance may, in addition to other passages, be infened
