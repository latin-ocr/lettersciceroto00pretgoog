Suspim‘tu] Suspiratu al., but, though found in Ovid
(Met. XIV. 129), the form is apparently not Ciceronian.

Da iudicia's] Cf. 1. 17. 8. lt is scarcely consistent or
honest of Cicero to complain that these measures had not

presided at the ceremonies.

former. He had conducted the campaign against Mithri-
