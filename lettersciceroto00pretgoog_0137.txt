placed by Atticus in his Amaltheum in Epirus. The passage
in question serves also to fix the meaning oi the verb perure,
which otherwise might have been understood of literaty com·
position, as in pariere lucum artifices (Pers. sut. 1. 70'). There
is much vanity and little courtesy in Cicero's acknowledgment
os th'e compliment.

Ciilr’us] Cf. Ep. t. 9. 2, from which Ι should refer to
take reliquerit in its literal sense, ‘has left mel thatrhiae,
however, understands it to mean ‘has neglected my praises!
For Archias and his poetn in praise oi Cicero's consulship
ci. tipepJ argument of the or. pro Archia, delivered in the
year 2.

Lucullis] ie. in honour oi Lucius and Marcus Lucullus
ou the subject oi the Mithridatic war (or. pro Arci. nc 21).
'And 1 am much afraid that, having completed his poem on
the Luculli, he has now got his eye on a Caecilian drama)
By Caecilianam he means Q. Caecilius Metellus Numidicus
and his son Pius, while in the word fabulam there is an allu-
sion to the plays oi the comic poet Caecilius.

ὁ §t6 Antom’up'ln reference, no doubt, to his proposed visit
to Asta, and to t e letter oi advice which Cicero had sent to
brittonius on the subject of his Macedonian debts. Cs. Ep. 1.

β· lilaulio] Titus Manlius. He was engaged in business at
Thespiae. Cf. Ep. ud div. xttt, 22. 1, but the reading. itseli
« varies between Manlio and Mollia.

Cui durem] ‘Because I could not lind a trustworthy
messenger, and, what is more, wasn’t sure of your address.
However, 1 have paid you out now!

Valde te vindicavi] ‘I have taken my revenge,’ ie. ior
your reproaches on my laziness in Ep. 5. 3, 6. 1, and else·
where. This allusion to the unusual length os the present
letter is precisely what we should have expected, and how so
admirable a reading can have been displaced in favour ol
ualde te venditari, ‘ 1 have been loud in your praise,' I am at
a loss to imagine. The long passage which has intervened
since the mention oi Antonius is alone fatal to the introduc·
tion oi vendituri. Vale, which appears in several editions
instead of valde, is abrupt and out oi place.

ἐ 18] ‘I want you to write me word what your Amal·
theum is like,—how decorated and how laid out: also to send
me any poems or legends you have on the subject of Amalthea.
Ι have a fancy ior making one at Arpinum. I shall be send·
ing you shortly some writings os mine, but at present have
nothing in a finished state!
