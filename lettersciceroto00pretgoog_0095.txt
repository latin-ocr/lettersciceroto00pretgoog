§6 T adiano rc] ‘Tadius‚ in respect tobis case, tells
me you have written him word that there is no need sor fur-
ther anxiety on his part, inasmuch as he has acquired a pre-
scriptive right to the inheritance. l am surprised at your
ignorance of the sacr, that, in the caso of a ward, no posses-
sion can give a legal claim! Schiitz gives the following cx·
planation os the passage: Tadius, as sels-constituted guardian
of an heiress who was still under age, had held her property
sor the two or more years which in ordinary cases (Ulp. in
fragm. tit. 19, or. pro Caec. XIX. 54) gave a prescriptive
right to ownership. By the advice of Atticus he pleads this
when the legal guardians os the girl claim the property at his
hands. But the property of wards was caresully protected
against any such claime, and, more than this, they could
only be dispossessed of it hya special decree. ln the or.
pro Flac. xxxiv. 84 tutela legitima is used absolutely of a
ward's property: nihil otest (le tutela legitima sine omnium
