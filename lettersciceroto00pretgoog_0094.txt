NOTES. 61

should have executed them forthwith on my arrival at Rome
after our parting, but, as it fell out, there was no need of any
such hot haste, and—knowing your tact as Ι did-I preferred
that Peducaeus should be your adviser rather than myself.
For after Ι had lent a listening ear to Acutilius for so many
days, whose style of conversation you know by experience‚ it
were surely no hardship to write you an account of his
grievances when Ι had made none of listening to them,
which was, Ι admit, rather a bore.'

confeceram] The ordinary explanation of this mood is
, simpler than to refer it, with Boot, to the purpose, as for
instance in the phrases nullum senatus consultum facienti
(Ι, 14. 5), and traducit (n' 18. 4).

llliltil} Mili, Boot: who for some unaccountable reason
objects to nilil. That there was no need for any particular
haste in the matter is sufficiently proved by the fact that two
years later (1. 4 1) it was still in progress.

Illius] Unless the interchange of the names is a typo-
graphical error Muretus refers this to Peducaeus: Cicera
‹lice't molestam sibifnisse loquacitatem et dicacitatem Pedu-
caei, qnam tamen molestiam in Pomponii gratiam patienter
devoravit. But Peducaeus was Atticus' own man of business
(ῐ. 4. 1), and the intended contrast is not between the men,
but between the words scribere and andire.

Facultatem dandi] ‘Opportunity of sending!

§5 Cuius] Lucceius.

Recalligt] ie. reconciliari. Cf. ῐ. roa for the use of
restituere in the same sense: primum tibi de nostra amico
placanda autetiam restituenda pollicear.

T enm qnid dicas] ‘1 understand your meaning! Teneo
is thesuggestion os Orelli, and its omission is more easily ac-
'counted for than that os scia or videa. Some verb of the kind
is required by the sense of the passage and by the word
neque which follows, for it is quite impossible to explain the
construction as an ellipse, which is the suggestion of Muretus.
ΙΙ the reading of the MSS is to be retained, l should prefer to
translate: ‘Yon say Ι ought to gather a few hints as to the
line you had better take with him!

Aetherius] ‘ln a strange state of mind' He purposely
uses an indefinite word, as the special cause of offence was
unknown to himself and his friend.

Contendendum' Concedendnm, Graev, Em, but contem
dere and elaborare are the words used in the corresponding
passages of Epa. 8 and 10. ‘What pressure we are to use
