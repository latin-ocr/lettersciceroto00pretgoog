many passages ol his letters!

With the criticism so farI am of course
altogether agreed, for the bitterest enemy os
Cicero could not have summed up his political
offences in a more brief and telling catalogue.
But to the delence which the writer proceeds
to set up, is defence it can be called, I take the
strongest possible exception. ‘On the other

shows a really disinterested affection as dis·
tinct from the merely formal compliments in
use between acquaintances are wonderfully
few and iar between. Else why quote iso-
