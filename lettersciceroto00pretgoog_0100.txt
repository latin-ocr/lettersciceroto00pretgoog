Scribebom] ‘For 1 am sitting there to write this letter, so
that the place itself puts in a word. In addition l give you
an order sor bas-reliess for insertion in the plaster walls oi my
ante-chamber, together with figured curbstones for my two
wells.’

T ypos] Small figures, usually formed os terra cotta: ci.
Plin. H. N. xxxv. 151 impresso argilla typum fecit, ct cum
caeterrifictilibus induratum igni proposuit.

Α trioli] To distinguish it from the atrium maz'us. ef.
Bek. Gal. 11. 176 and Ep. ad Quint. fral111. r. 1 neque
enim satz's loci esse virlebatur atriolo: neque sere solet nisi
in lis aedifictisfieri in qut'bus est atrium maius.

Putealia] Gk περιπόμιιι In Verr. 11. 4 14 the word
sigillati is used of raised work in silver.

§4] ‘Take care not to promise your library to any one,
whatever ardent admirers it may find. l arn hoarding up all
my little gleanings iu the hope of purchasing it sor the com-
fort οἱ my old age! .

§6 cimitiis meis] Muretus would explain this in reser-
ence to the consular election: while Manutius, Schiitz and
Abeken understand it ol the praetorship. The latteris in all
probability the correct view, as we know from other sources
(eg. Plut Cic. IX, proleg. Man. 1. 2) that the elections sor
the praetor urbanus were on the occasion of Cicero’s canvass
twice postponed-a fact which is clearly alluded to in §2 os
the ensuing letter. ‘As regards my election I do not iorget

ι that 1 have given you leave of absence, and indeed have

never ceased to proclaim it aloud to our mutual friends who
are on the look-out for you, that, so lar from pressing you to
corne, I have even put my veto upon it: understanding as 1
do that you will garn more by attention to your business at
home than 1 should by your presence at my electiori. Anci
therefore l hope you will be under the impression that lhave
sent you to your present quarters for the furtherance oi my
interests. For myseli, you will find me both in word and
deed as grateful to you as though my successes, whatever
they may be, had been gained, not only in your presence, but
⁴ by your exertions. Little Tullia is ior binding you to a day:
she gives your representative no peace! ·

Permisisse] 1 can find no other example ol this construc-
tion. Mr Sw1nburne however in his Atalantain Cal don
(p. 83) makes a somewhat similar use os the verb ‘ ow2’
‘But the godsAllowed us, and our days were clear ol these?

Quod intelligam] Quod intellio Boot, making with
