above, I believe it refers definitely to the loss of their ring-
the bitterest disgrace with which an eques could be visited

Aerati...aerarii] Tribuni aeran'isnnt ordinis plebeii (or
pro Plane. v.) etper eos militibus pecunia stipendiorum nume·
rabatur, ut est auctor Festus. Ern. ln accordance with the
above Muretus has proposed a rearrangement of the passage,
which is certainly ingenious: Tribuni uon tom aerarii, ut ab
pellantur, quam aerati. ‘Tribunes not so much ,baymasters
as receivers cypayi But this rematuresuggestion of bribery
is quite foreign to the tone a? the narrative, and it is to the
antecedents of the jurymen rather than to their conduct on
this occasion that the sarcasms evidently refer. Rejecting
therefore any explanation which would find a direct allusion
to bribery in the passage 1 should understand it somewhat
in the sense of maculosi above. Cf. Cluent. 43 itinerarios
resern', i. e. in ultimam classem, eui ascribti suffragio carebant,
et tantum aera tributi loeo pendebant. erat autem laec nota

but it bad been extended to include all the details upon
which the contending arties might require information
before the actual trial of tiie suit commenced.

Triumphauit] ‘ln a word Hortensius was in ecstacies
at his own foresight.’

Eu acclamatione] The order is audisse eu mennatum,
‘l think the uproar must have been loud enough to tell you ,²
and for the hyperbola compare the precisely similar expres-
sion usque istim exauditos in Ep. 14 4 It bas been
strangely enough proposed to contort the sentence into the
following fonn: eredo te audisse quae consurrectio sacta sit
ex acclancotione, ‘bow the jury rose as one man on hearing
the outcry raised by the partisans of Clodius) It may be
noticed in passing that nammatio in Cicero always denotes
desapprobation: differing in this iram the similar compound
admurmurare, which is likewise used in a favourable sense.
Cf in Pis. xlv. 31. On the sub'ect of advocatus it is scarcely
necessary to wana even schoolioys agdnst translating it ‘an
advocate' or ‘counsel’ Itis really uo moro than a friend,
