emendation oi Schlitz: el amantissimus mei, el illius nuuc
runem est littus atque ae'r el solitudo mera.

¹ Ambitiosae]‘For those political and counterleit friendshi s
make a certain dash in the eyes ol the world, but conllr
withal no home enjoyment.’

§ 2 Aculeus amites el scrupulas] ‘The thoms and stones
which beset the path os my family lise Ι will hide from you,

Terentia, which finally ende in her divorce: for, il this were
sc, the previous sentence, tantum requietis labeum qccanlum
cum unare consumitur, would be worse than eremmon-place.

Et uoluntas eliam] 1 have ado ted the very ingenious
emendationes Schiitz, with the ad itinn of the word etiam
which he omits. This is a closer adherence to the MSS than
the equally ingenious suggestion of Orelli, tamen cam iam
iasa meliciani deficit, ‘though I am with it heart and soul it is
now past all curel Either ol the above readings, even if it
does not represent the precise words os Cicera, has at any
rate a better right to stand in place of them than the unin-
telligible sentence which Nobbe and the other editors sanc·
tion, apparently without a doubt ol its authenticity. It
is just possible however that the passage might be made
translatable by reading uoluntate instead of voluutas, ‘not-
withstanding by deliberate choice it (sc. respublica) declines
the needsul remedy.' This suggests itself to me as a less
violent alteration than to reject uoluntas altogether (with
Boot and others) as a gloss on animus, who read the sen-
tence thus: in reiublica uero, quamquam animus est prae-
sens, menen elnam alque etiam ipsa medicinam refugii.
