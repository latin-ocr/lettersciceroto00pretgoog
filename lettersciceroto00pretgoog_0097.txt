64 NOTES'.

itam ei rem priuatim Sex. Roscius mandavisset, ut euru Clery·
sagana transigeret atque decideret: and pra Rasa. Cam. xl.
32 lite contestata, iudicia damni iniuria constituta, tu siue
me cum Flauia decidisti. ’

Gratum-..r'ueuudum] ‘A matter os thanks...a matter of
pleasure,' a distinction which is illustrated by the following
passages: Ep. Ι. 17. 6 suit milri saeue et laudes uestrae
gratulatio tua iueuuda et timeris causalatia grata: 111. 24. 2
uam ista ueritas, etiamsi iueuuda uau est, milei tamea grata
est, and again ad deu. 1V. 6. 1 cuius affieia iucundiora sci·
lieet saepe uetuifueruut, uunquam tamen gratiora.

Mihi amicissimus] ln Ep. ad div. v. 15. 2 he speaks os
his friendship with Lucceius in the strongest possible terms:
tecum uivere possem equidem et maxime uellem: uetustas,
amar, cousuetudo, studia paria : quad vinclum, perusa, deest
uestrae coniunctioni i

ξ 2 Pentelici] ‘From the quarries os Pentelicus! A further
explanation os the name is given by Suidas, who resers it to
the five lines with which the marble was stiiped.

Iam ureae] ‘Even by anticipation please me mightily.'
Cf. Prop. V. 11. 93 ‘Discite venturam iam nuuc sentire
senectam.² The prospective sense which distinguishes iam
nuuc irorn the corresponding phrase nuuc iam is probably
to be explained by the fact that in both cases the word iam
has lost its temporal force.

Caetera] Among which would be included such things as
the typos and the peetealia sigillata for which he gives an
order in the following letter.

Elegantiae] ‘Refined taste.' In the and Book of the T use.
disp. we have a full account of the Academia at Cicero's
Tusculan villa, where he tells us that it was laid out with
shady walks (xysta) and quiet seats (exedrae). Like the
Greek gymnasium it had two quadrangles, of which the
outer corresponded to the ἔξω δρόμος or ξυστός, while the
inner one was iurnished with seats ior philosophica] discus-
sion. The Lyceum, to which he refers in ele diu. 1. 5 as
superiori gymnasia, was apparently quite distinct from the
Academia in question.

Studia efferimur] ‘l am so enthusiastic on the subject!

κ Muuuseulum] ‘ls importunate for your present, and duns
me as your representative. To speak for myselss I am de,-
termined to repudiate rather than to pay! The munusculum
in question was no doubt promised on the occasion os her
betrothal to Piso. For appellare in this sense cf. Cic. Plu'l.
11. 29 appellatus es de pecunia quam pra dama, pro kartis,
pra sectraue debebas; and ior abiurare ci. Plaut. Cure. 1v.
