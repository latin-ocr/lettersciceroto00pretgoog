 

OF CICERO. xvii

were unquestionably predisposed in his favour
by the popularity os his cause. But this

promise was soon belied, and they left him
to strengthen other factione when all clue
to his conduct was lost in a maze of in-
consistency and vacillation. Reactions it is
true at times took place in his favour, (con-
cursus or ralhtzhgs is his own expression), ac·
cording as he gave glimpses of a more manly
and straightforward policy, but, often as these
were repeated, Ι cannot accept them as evi·
dence that he had secured any lasting hold
on the affections even of a few. In every
single instance we can trace. Ι think, the
signs of a momentary admiration, oftenerstill
of interested motives‚ but never a symptom
of that steady unwavering confidence by which
alone a man of Cicero's temperament could
have been nerved for any sustained effort.

A friendly critic¹ has summed up theHiga ιιιιιιι aar
character of Cicero 1n these words: ‘Nor εεηῖ dhffih ἢ
we wonder, however much we may lament1t ,Γξξξξξ,’,·,,
that nr times so corrupt as these even Cicero &⁰⁵⁵³
should not have been altogether free from ⁰⁶¹‘h
prevalent errors and defects. His early con-
nection with Catilina has been already no·
ticed‚ and the compact not less discreditable
which existed apparently between him and
Antonius as likewise his defence of that
worthless man who had committed such il·
legal acts in Macedonia We are surprised
also at the lukewarmness he at first tlt) mani-
fested in the case of Clodius: nor finally can
we fail to be struck with the conscious pride
and satisfaction, deserving no better name
