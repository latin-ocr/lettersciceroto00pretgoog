116 NOTES.

ship in the year 612, he condemns the practice as irregular
and contrary to precedent. At the present tirne, however,
the custom had become habitual, though the question re-
mains open whether the names of absentees were given in
through the provincial magistrate or collected (as Bekker
maintains) by a special agent ( procurator).

Sub lustnem] i. e. ‘at the close of the proceedings.' Cf.
Liv. 1. 44, Servius Tullius, censu perfecto ...instructum ener-
citum amnem suouetauribus lustravit: idque concb'tum lus-
trum appellatum, quia is censenda finis sactus est.

Germani negom'atorzi] has been usually understood as· a
complimentary term fora ‘true man of business,' a sense
which the words will undoubtedly bear. But from the
· passage which follows, it is clear that Cicero wishes to

, asten his friend's arrival, rather than to suggest a particu-

lar time for his coming, and it is therefore far more forcible
to take the words germani negociatoris in the disparaging
sense in which l see they are understood by Manutius,
Schiitz and Matthiae. The allusion is, in all probability, to
the preoccupations of a man of business: though there is
much to be said in favour of the inore elaborate explanation
suggested by Bekker: negociatores, ne plus minusve quam
haberent in censu praestarentur, quod ant rei suae autfidei

noceret, sub lustrum demum censorem adibant. atqui turpe ·

erat Α ltico, eqeeiti Romano, negociatoris morem sequi.
