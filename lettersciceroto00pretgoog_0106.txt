NOTES. ι 73

fellow is closeted with Antonius, who gives out, when he
makes his requisitions, that a portion os them is to go to me,
and that 1 have sent out this freedman to look after my
share os the gains. 1 have been seriously annoyed by the
report, although not quite believing it. However, the scandal
it has raised is considerable! ’

Libertum habea...clientem tuum] From this and similar
passages (or. pro Rosc. Am. v11. 19, Suet. Caes. 2) we find that
a libertinus could have two patroni, one in his character os
libertus, and the other in that of cliens.

Ratiocinatorem] He was probably in the service of Anto-
nius at the present time: or else the word may referto the
post he had originally held in Cicero's establishment.

Ι Valerius] He is mentioned again in Ep. ad div. xlv. 2. 2.
His duties were to interpret ior the ambassadors of subject
states on their arrival in Rome.

Partem nuti quaeri] This is usually referred to some
secret agreement between them in accordance with which
Cicero declined the province in his favour. But such an
explanation is quite inconsistent with what we know of the
characteres Cicern, who, whatever his faults may have been,
was certainly not grasping or covetous. Abeken's conjecture,
which is endorsed by Merivale, is iar more probable: that
Antonius had promised him a pecuniary remuneration if· he
would undertake his desence in the Senate against the pro-
secution with which he was threatened.

Plancium] The subject of the or. pro -Planau, anda
staunch friend oi Cicero in all his troubles. He was military
tribune in Macedonia at the present time. ·

§3 Α micasimumy The first mention in these letters of

the celebrated irien ship between Cicero and Pompeius
which (to judge from the account of their relations in Ep.
ad div. V. 7) must have been somewhat sudden in its
growth. Atticus never approved of it: most probably be
cause he had a keener iorecaste than Cicero in politics, aud
believed him to be altogether mistaken in his choice of a
patron. ln addition to which he may have seen how in-
sincere was the friendship, at any rate on the side of Pom·

ius.
pe Muciae] She was the sister ol Metellus, and the wile

ol Pompeius, who, on his retum from Asia, divorced her on
a suspicion oi adultery with C. Caesar.

P. Clodium] For a full account ol the matter, ci
Merivale‚ p. 63.
