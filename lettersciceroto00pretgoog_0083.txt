consulatum illurn nostrum, quern Curio ante ἀποθέωσιν

Infirmata] Ins'ormore like adumbrare and the Greek
ᾇποτυπᾴω and σκιαγραφξω is used of pointing. or sketching
m outhne: ‘my general impression oft e cand1dates.'

Narin omni mun. cana] ‘For myself, Ι shall spare no
pains on my canvass: and, as Gaul seems to exercise a
considerable influence upon the voting, l may possibly take a
trip there in September, as soon as the Roman law-courts have
cooled down or the vacation, on a mission to Piso, but so
as to be home againin January. As soon as l have got an
insight into the intentioris of our great men you shall know
the result With this exception, my path is clear: that is in
relation· to the civilian candidates)

Gallio] ie. Gallia Cispadana For the extent of this
influence cf. Philip. 11. 30, and the treatise de bell. Gall. L11.
T. Labienum togatae Galliae praeficit, quo maiore commenda-
tione conciliaretur ad consulatus petitionem.

Refrixerit] The word is used again in Ep. 11. 1. 6 of a
measure which was indifferently supported ; quod de agraria
lege quaeras, sane iam valletur regrixr'sse. From the second
Verrine oration we find that fort e last four months of the
Roman year there was an almost entire cessation of business
in the Roman law-courts, as the festivals and holidays were
crowded into that portion of the year.

Legati] ie. on alibero legatio or honorary embassy to
Piso. Caius Calpurnius Piso is meant, who was consul
with Acilius Glabrio in the year 67 B.c., and brother of the
Marcus Piso in whose consulship Clodius was tried for
sacrilege. As governor of Gallia Narbonensis he is the
subject of a sarcastic allusion in Ep. 13. aproepositumque
esse nobis pacr'fiemorem Allobrogum. At a later period he
was accused of peculation, and defended by Cicero (or. pro
Flac. 39), who procurecl his acquittal.

Prolixo] Casaubon believes the word to be equivalent to
valde laxa. But F orcellini suggests with greater probability
that the primary idea was that of running water, and that it
was originally used of garments. Hence we have prolibus
capillus of bose-flowing hair. Afterwards it became akin to
propensus. Thus we have prolixus animus, and (ad dio. vn.
5. 1) proriae promittere, and again (Ter. And. v. 8. 20) age
prolem. Finally in a speech of Cato (apud Aul Gell. vn. 3)
we find res prolixae used in the present seuse of secundae.

Competr'toribus urbam's] cimilian as opposed to military
rivals. The latter might any day return from a foreign
