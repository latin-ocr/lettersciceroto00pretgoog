x ΟΝ THE CHARACTER

the Roman officials. But, granting this, he ,
had yet nothing of the high principle which
was so conspicuous in Cato and Catulus, to
keep him straight amidst a mass of conflicting
interests, and, as a consequence, he was per-
petually betrayed into a time-serving policy
utterly unworthy of himself and most preju-
fghevybt dicial to his influence for good. Nothing
ruffi? illustrates this fact more clearly than his
Zfflff conduct throughout the Clodian prosecution.
Having set the matter in motion he is alarmed
the next moment at the probable conse
quences, and would gladly have compromised
it, had compromise been possible. Failing
which, he drops quietly out of the case, and
leaves the real work of the prosecution to be
undertaken by Cato, Cornificius and others,
himself the while looking on. Itis useless
for Abeken to plead in his defence that ‘he
could not take in a case at once,' when we
have his own express statement that his
conduct was the result of premeditation¹.
More than this he appreciated, no one better,
the real crises of the prosecution, to the first
of which he alludes in a passage of the
fourteenth letter⁹, while on the second and far
more important occasion, when Hortensius
proposed his scheme for the reconstitution of
the court⁸, Cicero keptaresolute silence,though
taking credit to himself for having foreseen
