7⁶. NOTES.

Orelli however understands it as referring to an old
chapel which Atticus had found on the estate, while Mr
Watson suggests the following explanation of the name: ‘A
villa in Ep1rus so called apparently from containing a room
decorated with pictures frorn the story of Amalthea’ But the
word τοποθεσίᾳ in Ep. 16. 18 is l think in favour of my view

Ad Sicyonem oppogrtandum] Cf. Ep. 19. 9, and 20. 4.
It is a playful allusion to certain payments which were due
to Atticus from Sicyon, either in his capacity of publicanus,
or else on account of a loan which he had· advanced to the
state. The former is the more probable theory, for we find
that about this time Sicyon, as one of the liberi populi,
received certain exemptione from tribute which were an evi·
dent loss to the com any who farmed her taxes.

A similar conflictlretween public and private interests is
(alluded tg in)connect10n with the portorium circumvectionis
Ep. 11. 1 . 4.

Antonium] Ep. ad dio. v. 5 is a letter of recommenda-
tion from Cicero-to Antonius in reference to this visit of
Atticus, the special object of which appears to have been the
recovery of certain sums which were owing to him in Mace·
donia.

importance enough to warrant a letter, which must not how·
ever be exposed to the risk of being lost, or opened, or

mur of disapproval ran through the house. For myselfl arn
pleased rather than otherwise, for 1 arn free from any obliga-
tion to a wayward fellow, and at liberty to assert my osition
in the state in spite of him; while the second spe er in a

pendence unfettered by any compliment from the consul?

Paczficatoram Allobrogum] C. Calpurnius Piso, the bro·
ther of the present consul, and himself consul in the year
67 ne. ln his proconsulship he had quelled some sli ht
tumult in Gaul (cf. or. in Cot. 111. o 22). Casaubon iniere
from the notice in the text that the compliment in question
had been paid to Cicero the year before by the consul

Silanus.

Admurmuronta] For the use of this verb in a losa'le
sense we may compereor. Verr. 11. 5. 16 quam valdo uni·
