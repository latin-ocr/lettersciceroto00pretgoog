52 NOTES.

Atticus, cap. v. As he had by this time returned from his
campaign in Asia against Mithridates there is no need to

under the name of Q. Caec. Metellus Pius Scipio. ln the
civil war he espoused the cause of Pompeius, and killed
himself after the battle of Thapsus in nc. 46.

Magistrum] We have no one word in English to express
the various relations of the magister in a Roman case of
baukruptcy. He was usually selected from the number of
the creditors, and was at once auctioneer and assignee of the
proceeds of the sale which he was appointed to conduct in
their interests. (Cf. or. pro Quint xv. 50.) Trs. ‘receiven'

L. Pontius] L. Pontius Aquila Cf. ad Are. v. a. 1, and
Philto. x111. 13. 27.

, Nunccogooscere] There seems to be no good reason for
discrediting the reading of the text: which is at any rate
sufficiently intelligible. ‘Tm question as to who is to be
receiver is premature and absurdae when we do not as yet
so much as know whether Satrius will be condemned or his
property sold! On the other hand Madvig's emendation:
oerum ltoe rzilz'culum est de magistro. Nune cognosce rem:
which Klotz and Boot have admitted into their text, ingenious
as it undoubtedly is, appears to me to be somewhat devoid
of meaning, for, without the addition of the words nunc
cognoscere, it is quite impossible to see anything ludicrous
in the mention of an auctioneer. Boot raises an objection to
the reading cognoscere on the following ground: ‘Vulgo
putabant Pontium magistrum· fore; sed, quam diu incertum
erat, utrum bona Varii venirent necne, de magistro eognosce-
oat nemo) But cognoscere is ‘to take into consideration‚’
and the opposition which he discovers between it andputont
does not appear to me to exist

observat] A stronger word than colere but used much in
the same sense. Cf. Ep. 13. asum enim ob observando
bomine perversoliber.

same time assuring him that, had the suit been confined to
himself and Satrius, 1 would have done my best to oblige
