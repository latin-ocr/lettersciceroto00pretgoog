Mr Watson understands it, but ‘in spite of my satisfaction

Quod in ectum est] lt is not to the bad example of Clo-
dius that e alludeS, as it is explained by Muretus and
others, butro the discord which it was producing, as shewn
by the fact that the two consuls took different sides in the

uestion ln his eagemess to prevent an open rupture in
t e Senate Cicero would probably have dropped the case in
toto, if the right feeling of Cato and others had not made
such a course impossible. As it was, he shewed a want of
energy in the matter most discreditable to himself, and no
doubt most prejudicial to his influence for good in the state.

[restaurassent] ‘After the fresh performance ofthe sacri-
fice:' for the first had been pollured by a man's presence.
This is the regular sense of instaurare, ‘to repeat a sacri·
fice,' cf. liv. v. 19, Verg. A erc 111. 62. Occasionally, as in Verg.
Aen. lv. 145, it means ‘to repeat again and a ain? Ideoque,
which Sch'dtz has adopted in place of idque, tffough it greatly

Ep. 1. r, where he is mentioned as an unsuccessful candidate
for the consulship. Even Abeken is not quite satisfied with
Cicero's conduct on this occasiomwhich he criticisesasfollows:
‘He was lukewarm in the performance of the duties devolv-

ing on a consular... ln January, 693, Q. Cornificius brought ζ
the matter before the Senate. We are surprised that this ,³
should not have been done by a senator of more conse· r
quence; but Cicero, though he likewise expresses astonish- ¹

ment at the circumstance, did not offerto come forward’
Nostrum] ‘Men of my own standing,' i.e. of consular

ranle Why is Cicero so particular to mention this facti ,

Not, as is commonly suggested, to cast blame on the consu·
lars,himself amongst the number, but because he fancies that
Atticus will sanction his irresolute policy in a matter the issues
of which were as yet so uncertain

Nefas] ‘Sacrilege’ The rogatio in question was to
enable a special court of enquiry to be held on the circum·
stances of the case.
