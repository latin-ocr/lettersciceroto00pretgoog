(2) The reference to Cornelius, who may possibly be the
agent os Caesar alluded to in Ep. ad Α tt. 11. 3. 3 nam fuit apud
me Cornelius, hunc dico Balbum Caesarei familiarem. It is,
however, probable that another Cornelius is meant, of whom
mention is made in Ep. ad div. v. 6. 1. If so, the introduc·
tion of his name may throw some light on the remainder of
the passage, as he was connected by marriage with Publius
Sextius, the quaestor of Antonius, and managed his business
at home during his absence in the province.

(3) Α far more important hint is given us in the imme·
diate transition to Antonius and his affairs, which follows in
the words sed nescio an ταύτόματον ἡμῶν, nam milri &c
This connects the monetary question so closely with the
recall and prosecution of Antonius that we can scarcely

avoid the inference that the allusion is either to Antonius
himself, or to one of his most intimate friends.

At first sight the arguments against the hypothesis that
Τεῦκρις and Antonius are identical are clear and telling, and
they have been ably marshalled by Schiitz. For instance,
why should Cicero use the mysterious designation in one
sentence, and in the next mention Antonius by name? And
why, if he expects money for undertaking his defence, does
he in the same breath announce his determination to aban·
don it? But in spite oi these arguments, and even on the
strength of them, 1 believe that Antonius himself is the
Trirptr of the text, more especially as an evident motive for
concealing his real name in connection with the proposed
loan, and also for renouncing all interest in his defence, is
supplied by Cicero himself in this very letter. With the story
of Hilarus full in view it would scarcely have been well to let
the world about him know that he was at that very moment
expecting large sums from Antonius, and for the same reason
it was only a politic measure to denounce his actions, at
least till the scandal of Hilarus had died out: for as a matter
of fact he did defend him in spite of his present assertions
to the contrary. Cf. or. pro dom. xvi. Amongst other
attempts to veil the nature of the present transaction we
may instance the introduction of Terentia's name in place
