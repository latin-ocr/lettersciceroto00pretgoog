Lentum sane negocium] However, in Ep. 12. 7 we lind
the following: Τεῦκρις promissa patravit. Considius is men-
tioned as a money-lender in Val. Max. lv, 8, Axius in Ep.
ad Art. x. 11. 2, and Selicius in 1v. 18. 3.

Caecilio} The uncle of Atticus. Cf. 1. 2. The present
passage is quoted in full by Seneca (Ep. 118) in illustration
of ¹the character of Caecilius For a further account of his
pride and avarice cf. Nep. Ait. vit. v,

· Minore centesimis] ln proof that 1 per cent. per month
was a heavy rate os interest Boot refers to ad div. V. 6. 2,
where ὲ per cent. (semissibus) is mentioned as the current
rate at the time. It is noticeable that in the corresponding
passage of Seneca’s letters the unusual construction minore
centesimis is replaced hythe more ordinary phrase minoris
centesimis, which was in all probability rejected by Cicero
as offensive to the ear.

ταύτόματον ἡμῶν] κάλλιον βουλεύεται, ‘chance is wiser than
we,' a line from Menander (Γνωμ. μονοστ, in fragm. Com.
Gr. lv. p. 361, Meineke). Unless we accept the identity
of Τεῦκρις with Antonius, the connection between this pas·
sage and the foregoing—Cicero's impecuniosity and Antony's
recall-appears to me an insoluble problem.

Α gei praetor ad populum] He alludes to the formal motion
for the recall and prosecution of Antonius,

Homimm desemine] Yet he had already done so (cf.
Ep. ad div. V. 6. 4), and afterwards, when Antonius under-
went a second and more severe prosecution under the
consuls Caesar and Bibulus, he again defended him but
without success. (Merivale's Life and Letters, p. 59.)

Hoc] ‘The following circumstance' For accidit Schi'rtz
reads accedit. But we should have expected in that case
the familiar phrase accedit quod without the introductory
word etenim: sor, whenever a verb has come to form part
of a phrase, Cicero rarely introduces a word to brealr the
legitimatecombination. ¹

character of which I wish you to look carefully. lhave a
freedman, one Hilarus by name, a rascally fellow enough,

Chilius writes me word that it has reached him: that the
