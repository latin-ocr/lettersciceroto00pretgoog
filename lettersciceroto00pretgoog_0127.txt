94 NOTES.

god looks down on us with mercy, already slipped from our
hands by this one judgment-il that can be called a judg-
ment, when thirty rnen, the most irivolous and abandoned of
the Roman people‚ violate sor a paltry bribe every right·
human and divine3 when a Thalna, a Plautus, a Spongia,
and other resuse like these, maintain that a deed was not
committed which all men, aye and the very brutes them·
selves, know to a certainty was committed. But yet for your
consolation let me tell you, that, although the state has
received this heavyb10W, still villainy is not so wantonly
triumphant in the hour of victory as the vicious had antici·
pated. For they thought that if religion, chastity, the honour
of the judge5‚ and the authority ol the Senate, could be over·
turned, then recklessness and lust might openly revenge
themselves on the good among us, for the pain my austere
administration had inflicted on the bad? Meriv.

Elapsum da manibus] He uses the same expression os a
trial in the de aral. 11. 50. 202 nihil unquam vam, quod lam
e manibus elaberetur, quam milti lum esl elapsa illa causa.

Thalnam el Plautum et Spongiam] Contemptuous names
adopted lor the occasion from the lowest class ol slaves.
The derivations to which Casaubon would refer each ol ¹
these words are, excepting as regards Spongia, very sar·
fetched. 1t is surely enough to suppose that in many cases,
though by no means in all, the name of a slave had reference
to his occupation. Thus Spongia is almost precisely identi-
cal with Peniculus, the name ol the parasite who plays so
{illustrarillll{villariis}'‘llilltiti
est (v. 7. 75). But to attimpt to find a special allusion ol
the same kind in so common a word as Plautus is surely
somewhat lanciful.

Quisqailias] repperis, the sweepings of a stable. He
uses the same wor os the same class in his speech pro
Sestio, in which he calls Numerius, Serranus and Aelius
‘quisquiliae seditionis Clodianae'

ἓ 7 Dolam‘s quem...z'ausseral] a favourite phrase with our
auth0r; cs. or. ia Verr. 11. 1. 44 cur lunc dolorem cinari eius
alque ossibus inussisti? and again or. pro Mil. xxxvl nul·
lum milli lantum dolorem l'auretis; and again Plrr'l. xt. 15.
38 lertio gemm.. cupio quamacerbissimum dolorem inurere.

ξ 8 Ab aliis lagi A reading which Klotz has introduced
into his text, and to which Madvig (adsta. p. 29) gives a
qualified apptokal. For alia lagi cl. ad Aa. xvl. 1312. 1.
For the sentiment Matth. compares ad div. xv. 21. ς alz'ler
