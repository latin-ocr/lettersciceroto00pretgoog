xx ΟΝ THE CHARACTER

question.) But the most significant fact of
all is that throughout these sixteen books of
letters we are kept in almost total ignorance
of Atticus and his concerns. Ι should scarce-
ly have thought it possible to write four let-
tere, much less four hundred, to a friend in
whom one was deeply interested, without in-
troducing questions and allusions which would
have enabled the reader in some degree to pic·
ture to himself his occupation and habits. On
the part of Atticus at any rate there was no
such want of sympathy, as may be gathered
from the pointed questions in reference to
his friend’s doings, which are noticed and
answered by Cicero in almost every letter.
But on the other side there is certainly no
response of sympathy. The allusions os
Cicero to his friend's occupations are of the
most meagre and unsatisfactory kind, shuffled
as a rule into three or four lines at the end
of a letter, and withal so devoid of interest
that to the end of the chapter Atticus is little
else to the reader than an epistolary dummy,
on which are hung the trophies of Cicero’s
lif . If this view of his character be the cor-
rect one, we are at no loss to account for
his own statement, that, with the exception
of Atticus, he had no real friend. And in
this lay one of the great secrets of his weak- =
nese, for it is most certain that no man ever
needed thern more. Cicero was not one who
could mark out his path and pursue it inde-
pendently of counsel and advice. Even in
these letters we see at every turn the child·
like reliance he places on the discretion and
foresight of Atticus, and can gather that his
was beyond question a character which the
devotion of a few true friends might have
