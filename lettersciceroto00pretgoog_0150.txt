§2 Gallici belli uersaturmctus] Gallici versantur metus
(as Boot reads from a single MS), or Gallici versantur,

words iu republica are against our accepting the latter.

Fratres nostri] The Aedui in return for their services had
received this title as acompliment from the Senate. Cf. Caes.
dc bell. Gall. 1. 31, and Ep. ad div. v11. 10. 3.
